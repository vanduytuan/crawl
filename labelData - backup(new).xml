The steak here was phenomenal, as was the asparagus and the potatoes. Definitely one of the best steaks we have had. Of course the restaurant is a little pricey, but worth every penny. The atmosphere was great, we were able to get in without a reservation with only about 15 minutes of waiting at the bar. We loved the view - I would recommend making a reservation to ensure you can have a table by the window. The service was also extremely good, once again some of the best service we have had. We will definitely come here again!</review><polarity>1</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

As a lover of French cuisine I was curious as to how this would compare and I was delighted. The service from start to finish was exemplary and the food was sublime. My wife has the individual Beef Wellington and was blown away by it. My frogs legs and filet mignon were delicious too. My wife loved the fact that the waiters look like door bouncers and ours was highly attentive and knowledgable of both the menu and wine list. It's a busy place and I can see why. As an avid "fine-diner" I was thoroughly impressed and will recommend this restaurant to all. Parfait!</review><polarity>1</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

I have worked with many venues around the country - including others in Vegas - and I can say this was one of the best I've worked with all around. They pleasantly surpassed all expectations. The Left Bank Room had a great view of the Strip and Bellagio fountains below and fit approximately 100 guests comfortably., The management and staff was more than professional/helpful, they did not nickel and dime us as other Vegas venues do, and the food was delicious - great compliments from all attendees on the hors d'oeuvres and service. I give it a triple thumbs up!</review><polarity>1</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

The food has an unamerican quality. The tastes are subtile and delicate, unlike most restaurants in the US where dishes have a certain blandness. The Soprano's-like waiters provide a contrast with the overall high quality of the restaurant. They should definitely learn to blend in with the surroundings like their Euorpean collegues in top class restaurants like these do.</review><polarity>1</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

The food is well presented and delicately cooked. The staff were polite and not in your face. The portions are also normal and not crazy size!!!!! Drinks were very well presented and my wife tried one of the wines befor ordering and they had no problem with that. I had a GandT it came with the tonic already in it and I thought it may have been too weak, but not at all. About the only thing I can say is wrong is the service stations too close to some of the window tables and you could have a lot of noise going on behind you. We were offered one of these tables and when we asked to move it was no problem at allI know some people say things are no problem for the staff but this really is true. There were no rolling of eyes or thinning of lips :-)Well worth a visit</review><polarity>1</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

I had made the reservation about two months beforehand and requested a table with a view. They advised that the only way to secure a table with a view was to make a reservation for 5:45 p.m. We didn't want to eat that early, so I made the reservation for 6:45 p.m. I explained that it was going to be our wedding night dinner and that we really wanted a table with a view. They said that they would do what they could but it wasn't guaranteed. The night of our wedding we headed over to the restaurant. We went in our wedding attire and couldn't be happier with the service! They got us in right away and were even able to accommodate our request for a table with a view. We had a spectacular view of the Bellagio fountains from our table. In addition to our amazing meal the Chef even sent us a few different samples of food to try. It was a great place for a special occasion dinner! We loved every minute of it!</review><polarity>1</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

We asked for a seat by the windows facing the Bellagio (so we could watch the fountains), and we were told that the 5:00 and 5:15 seatings are guaranteed a window seat. We were given a table with a lovely view. Our waiter, Gary, went out of his way to make us feel welcome; in fact, the whole staff "spoiled" us! I ordered the salmon, and my sister ordered a filet. We asked if we could share our entrees, and Gary personally halved our orders and arranged them on our plates. We both had souffle for dessert - pistachio for me (scrumptious!) and chocolate for my sister. Yes, the dinner was expensive, but we enjoyed ourselves immensely. Isn't that what treating ourselves is all about?</review><polarity>1</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

The lobster and caviar were also very good even though I dont like caviar that much.We had a window seat with an excellent view of the Bellagio fountain.

Overlooking the Bellagio and the fountains added an element to a great dinner experience. We ordered the tasting menu with wine pairing - and the menu was very tasteful. I am allergic to Shell fish and had forgotten to inform of this in advance - but no problem at all. They just served an alternative course to me instead of the course containing crab. Being a tasting menu, we did not expect large portions - but this is US, so the courses were what you would categorize as "normal size" in Europe. And both my husband or I had to "surrender" and not finish all courses - even though they tasted great! Nice atmosphere and great service. We would not hesitate to recommend this restaurant!</review><polarity>1</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

We were seated promptly, we had a nice table on the second tier but with a good view of the Bellagio. Patrons should not fret about obtaining a table next to the windows, as I think the view of the fountains is going to be reasonably good from most tables. Pleasant atmosphere, not quiet, but neither is it noisy. One can easily converse at normal voice levels. Good wine list, well-prepared cocktails. This place gets a gold star for having two, not just one, foie gras appetizers on the menu. Excellent! Salads and main courses were all delightful. Our dessert souffles were good, although perhaps a half-step below what one can obtain in France. Service was pleasant and professional, appropriate to the atmosphere. Fortunately, it appeared everyone was dressed appropriately, according to the dress code, which is essentially business casual. Highly recommended - not inexpensive, however.</review><polarity>1</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

Had a nice table by the window, but COLD air blew from the a/c system along the window. Waiters comment was YES, IT BLOWS UP THE WINDOW ON AN OFF. I had brought along a blazer, was shivering, so were gals and tables on either side of us. One commented that maybe the staff were comfortable, but the restaurant should be more concerned about the comfort of the guests. My husband reached for his drink and poked his hand on a knife (they are positioned on their side with point up?), bled on his shirt, tablecloth, no assistance in sight, finally went to the restroom to clean up what he could. My husband's appetizer was wrong, waiter noticed (someone else delivered it), long wait for replacement, I was done with mine by then. My husband asked to order wine with dinner, waiter did not come by. I ordered venison, came extremely rare, returned, long wait, still so rare I was nauseated, Long wait, host came by and offered to make another meal, by then my husband was finished with his dinner. No acknowledgement of my husband's birthday. Check was $169, without my dinner...left hungry, cold, frustrated and sad that our special evening had been so miserable. Waiter seemed unconcerned and almost irritated.</review><polarity>-1</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

Reservation was lost although we were seated fairly promptly in spite of them not being prepared for a table of 4. 2. 10mins passed before being greeted with "you don't have a server, so I will take care of you..." by what we assumed was a floor manager, service did NOT improve. 3. 4 top, 3 course dinner lasted 2.5 hours and we did NOT ask for slow pace. We actually had to CANCEL our plans for a late show. 4. At no point was our opinion of "the experience" solicited. Just "Thanks for joining us, etc..." not once were we asked how things were.. Rather than embarrass our guests we chose to suffer the poor experience and leave (paying a full tab of course-we don't want free stuff, just good value and service for the expensive meal) 5. Positives: food quality, view, secondary service staff (Guillermo), menu/wine list. As food service professionals, we understand that issues occur. However, at this level it's reasonable to expect management to be more aware (2.5hours!?) and at least acknowledge mistakes or challenges. ** The food deserved good service but the service demanded an apology.</review><polarity>-1</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

We watched the street gelow, the water show at the Bellagio across the street, and the staff set up for dinner. The service was excellent -- funny, friendly, and attentive without being intrusive. The wine by the glass selection was a little thin -- we expected more French options -- but the pours were generous and we enjoyed what we ordered.

I ordered the aged parmesan crusted chicken which was pounded thin and very crispy- very good. my husband ordered the lamb burger and he thought it was delicious. The staff was friendly without being intrusive and the atmosphere was fun. There was a newly married couple and a small bridal party having a celebration which was fun to watch.

We visited late afternoon, before it got busy. No reservation. From the moment we arrived we were treated like visiting Royalty. Our waitress was attentive and very helpful, but not hovering, if you know what I mean. In a word, the service we received was impeccable. For starters, we had the Main Lobster Salad (see pic). We told the waitress that it was too beautiful to eat, but we did and it was delicious. My main course was the Char Broiled Filet Mignon, Lemon Parsley Butter. It was perfection. My wife had the Slow Roasted Filet of Pacific Salmon, Pinot Noir Sauce. She was equally pleased. We both washed the meal down with one of their delicious cocktails. For desert, we both had their Creme Brulee. Again, it was perfect. And I had to tell the waitress that we loved their American-sized portions. This was not our first French restaurant, and the others would serve you this tiny portion surrounded by plate, but we were quite full and satisfied when our meal was finished at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant. I recommend it heartily. You will not be disappointed. We plan to dine their a few more times on our next Vegas visit.</review><polarity>1</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

Yes, there is a dress code, and all men must wear a collared shirt. So my boyfriend in his cashmere sweater had to wear his coat the entire meal, which wasn't horrible, but just wish we'd known earlier. There were plenty of men less nicely dressed than he was but with collars, so whatever.If you're a foodie, I'd try somewhere else, however, the view can't be beat and I don't regret going.</review><polarity>0</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

We had tried a few other restaurants before arriving here who had told us they were closing soon so when they never mentioning closing soon we assumed. The courses came on top of each other and we was presented with our bill at 10.15 without asking for it. The scallop starters were under cooked. The lamb chops which I requested medium were still breathing because they were so under cooked. All in all very dissapointed.

Food and service were excellent as expected. This was our first visit. The meal was not as expensive as I expected based on what I had read. Also found the dress code to be more than relaxed at brunch -- there were plenty of shorts and casual wear found among the diners. We went late -- 1 pm on a Sunday. Although we had a reservation there would have no problem getting a table. Nice view of the Bellagio fountains across the strip -- which run every 15 minutes during Sunday brunch. We were staying in a casino on the north end of the strip -- and the only inconvenience was finding the entrance to this place. We wandered in by way of the bridge from Bally's and the directional signage really needs help. Stop and ask to save yourself some walking.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

I wrote a TripAdvisor review titled "Overall A Disappointment"; unbeknownst to me a restaurant employee monitors these reviews and Mr. Lyle Tolhurst, Restaurant Supervisor, answered my review in a very concerned and considerate manner. So we again dined at ETR Sunday, March 17th. and enjoyed what probably was the very best ever experience in the restaurant. We were seated promptly at a prime window table with views toward Caesar's and Mirage in one direction, the outlandish monstrosity City Center in another, and directly across Bellagio and the beautiful fountains. My partner enjoyed the escargot and foie gras appetizer, Caesar salad and pheasant all of which he said were exceptional. I had the cold smoked salmon, Caesar salad and filet mignon; the salmon and filet just melted in my mouth and the salad was quite flavorful. Of course, I also ended the meal with the plate of wonderful chocolates and chocolate ice cream. Our table was delightfully and expertly attended by Carmen Darie, Restaurant Captain, who treated us with great friendliness and humor and added so much to our dining experience. You bet we will return again and again! Mahalo to all the ETR staff!</review><polarity>1</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

Around 7:30, we began wandering around for a place to eat. Everything on the perimeter of the casino was packed, so we took a flyer as a walk-in at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant. While we would only have had a 30 min wait for a table, we were lucky to find a couple of seats at the bar. The service was fast, but attentive. The food came out of the kitchen quickly. The frenched lamb chops my husband ordered were magnificent. Cooked to a med- rare perfection, coated with a wonderful rub and a delightful tomato confit/eggplant side. My mushroom soup and lobster/kale salad were both delicious. We were impressed with the consistency of the kitchen and we found the prices of food and wine to be fairly priced for a high end restaurant. Of course the view of the Bellagio fountains didn't hurt the atmosphere. We would return again and recommend to others.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Don't get me wrong the outside of the hotel and a lot of the details very much take you back to actual Paris but there is just a little dated factor about the hotel and also that it is really small as compared to say Bellagio or Ceasars.Well this review is not for the hotel and more for the restaurant anyways but just wanted to paint a picture leading towards the restaurant. It is one of those cases where you really shouldn't judge a book by its cover. As soon as you take the elevator up to the restaurant and come around the corner to the hostess desk you are greeted with views of the entire strip. The whole restaurant has huge floor to ceiling windows showcasing all the lights and luckily none of the sounds of the strip which is magical and most of all you get the best view of the Bellagio fountains which is phenomenal in itself. The food here is exceptional and prices are not bad at all compared to what you could spend at other high end dinning establishments on the strip. The wine list is definitely the more expensive option with not so many cheaper options. So I would think of this place as a special occasion type of place more than just "this looks nice. lets's have dinner here!!" kinda place.It was a fantastic and opulent experience which one should definitely plan for while in vegas. Oh yes and please definitely get the Foie Gras.</review><polarity>1</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

The service was attentive with my water glass and wine glass always full and just a short wait between each course.I have nothing but good things to say about my wonderful meal at this splendid restaurant.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We had a view of the bellagio fountains which was lovely. Our waiter warmed up during the course of the evening. The food was well prepared and beautifully presented. Very expensive but we knew that; the drinks, too. The dinner menu was a la carte but I found that the portion size of my entree was more than enough - although I have to add that I probably eat less than the average person. It's definitely nice to indulge at a fancy restaurant once in a while if your budget allows. Expect to pay through the teeth, but also expect a great meal and experience. The Eiffel is worth a visit.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

And we're not completely baller, so we need to make our money stretch. So, LUNCH at the Eiffel was totally the ticket for us. We were careful to reserve on Friday, because brunch there is a whole other pricerange. We were there over Thanksgiving, so Friday was our only window. We reserved a table for right when they opened. We of course got a fantastic window seat and were REALLY surprised and pleased that they did 4 Bellagio fountain shows early because it was a holiday weekend. The food on the lunch menu has 'normal' dinner prices, but it was fantastic. We each had a middle priced entree, a non-alcoholic "fancy" drink, and shared an amazing dessert and where out of there for $75 total. Pretty damn good for such an upscale experience. I was surprised that the dumb kid next to us showed up in flip flops and shorts. Does anyone have pride in appearance anymore? But overall it was a fantastic experience and value and we'll do it again in a heartbeat.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

It was a Thursday night and we had made reservations. We got there about 1 hour early and they were still able to seat us in the very crowded restaurant by the window with a perfect view of the Bellagio Fountains. It was beautiful and very romantic. We ordered the Filet Mignon with Lemon Butter and the other with a wine sauce as well as 2 sides of gratin potatoes (which we could have split just one order), and water to drink. The bill was $160. They give you a small, actually tiny, appetizer and a choice of bread. Because it was our anniversary we were given a small parfait to share, on the house. It was a wonderful experience. We have never paid that much for a meal before, but the food and experience were worth every penny. The staff were also very attentive and made our night special.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Service was outstanding ... attentive, but not overly so as other reviewers have mentioned. We were served Sunchoke Mousseline and Cheese Puffs. I ordered the Half Avocado appetizer, Eggs Benedict and Creme Brulee. My husband ordered the Creamy French Onion Soup, Eiffel Tower Classic Hamburger and the Sorbet Sampler. All of the food was delicious. the Creme Brulee is probably the best I've ever had.Would definitely return. Dinner next time.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

If not, don't say you weren't warned. There is not a better restaurant view in Las Vegas. The restaurant is glass enclosed at the midway point up the Eiffel Tower replica at the Paris Las Vegas Hotel. It overlooks Las Vegas Blvd and the Bellagio Fountains, which is as good as it gets. Personnel are professional, well trained, immaculately turned out, and well versed in accommodating a discerning clientele. The food is best quality and expertly prepared and presented but.................doesn't taste all that good. This Louisiana boy is admittedly spoiled in that regard. But, would it kill them to use a little salt and pepper? So by all means go, but skip the table reservations and have cocktails and a small plate at the bar where the view is just as spectacular. The Hostess guarding the Tower elevator on the casino floor will admit you for drinks without a reservation as long as you are well dressed. Business casual or better will do. But by all means, let your attire match the glamour of this place. My wife and I saw the 5 pm Jersey Boys show at the Paris and then had dinner afterwards at Eiffel Tower for her birthday. Best date we ever had.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We made a reservation for the advertised 5pm sunset where you get a table with the best views at the front overlooking the Bellagio fountains. The table right against the glass are only for 2 people so we got a booth style table just behind - lovely setting. The blinds were down (but see-through) until the sun set behind the Bellagio at 6:30 and they came up just in time for the fountain show. The menu choice was good and the food we all received was of excellent standard. This is not a cheap place to eat, so probably best saved for a celebration meal or special occasion! I received a complimentary dessert served on a plate that said Happy Birthday around the edge - nice touch. The only negative comment I would make is that whilst we appreciate good service, the staff were a little over-powering. There were constantly at least 3 or 4 staff hanging around waiting to pounce, we got asked if everything was ok by 3 different people and the main waiter was looking over at us the whole time we sat there and I personally felt uncomfortable with this. We chose not to pay extra to take the ride up the tower as we did the Stratosphere only the day before and didn't think we could possibly top the view!</review><polarity>0</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

Food was certainly excellent quality but not anything you couldn't get somewhere else for less. We really enjoyed the hazelnut chocolate cake, it was to die for! Overall, the service experience was a bit uncomfortable. We sat for almost 10 minutes before we were offered a menu and a chance to order drinks. We were rushed through our entree; the server even took my plate of bread and the side we ordered WITHOUT ASKING before I had a chance to finish eating! I would have liked to try the potato gratin! The waiter kept sneaking up on us and standing directly behind us without saying anything. It was very disconcerting. For the price of this restaurant, we expected better. I would recommend this for the location but not for the service or food.</review><polarity>0</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

This was her first trip to Sin City and I haven't been there in 14 years. We are not gamblers. First of all, we had a great time doing a lot of free and fun things. We decided on one expensive dinner so we choose the Eiffel Tower restaurant in Paris Las Vegas. We had a spectacular window view of the Bellagio Fountains which go up every 30 min. The food was excellent and the service was slow enough to enjoy our dinner and conversation. Drinks are expensive but not weak. We both enjoyed our filet minon and rack of lamb respectively. Cooked to our specifications and not rushed. Yes, it is $$$$ but worth it if you really want to spurlge. While we were there a young couple was celebrating their wedding dinner still dressed in their formal wedding attire. They came from France to get married in Las Vegas and go the Paris Las Vegas and the Eiffel Tower for their private celebration. All in all Las Vegas has changed a lot in 14 years but still has that special charm.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The service was poor. our waiter was fine but plates were removed in front of our faces. The bread is delivered by a busboy in a large tray, you pick out what you want and he/she places it on your bread plate from one position so it is served across the table. The bread was cold, not room temperature, cold. Another thing to note is that although it is advertised as a Paris Hotel restaurant it does not except or qualify for "Reward" points.After eating at a few of the so called "high end steak houses" in Las Vegas. My advice is to go to the middle of the road steak houses close or in your hotel and you will do just fine.</review><polarity>0</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

We both had salads, a steak (NY for me and Filet for her), brussel sprouts, and potato dishes. We finished with the chocolate soufflé which was fantastic. The staff, the experience, the pictures, and the memory was awesome.

The service from the staff was great; from the moment we were greeted in front of the elevators to the moment we exited the elevators to leave the Paris hotel/casino. We had an incredible view of the Bellagio fountain show from our seats. It was a semicircular table abutting the glass walls which gave us a great view of the Vegas strip. The food was served in a timely manner, had a great presentation and was quite tasty. We had the duck breast, and sea bass, and souffle for dessert. I would HIGHLY recommend this restaurant (more so for special occasions or if you care to splurge while in Vegas)</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The sommelier recommended a very nice half-bottle Bordeaux from Margaux. The food and wine were all most enjoyable but we were especially impressed by the service from waiter captain Anthony Jamison.

If you're looking for the full-on French fine dining experience in Vegas, this is an easy call. I'll break it down easy...Pros- Well executed versions of standard French fine-dining fare, and a few imaginative additions.- Outstanding views from almost every seat, but especially if you can get a window seat.- Service is fairly high-end for Vegas. These people are trained to provide a passable high-end experience.- They'll take special arrangements in advance and usually can accommodate.Cons- You have to walk through Paris, Paris to find the elevator up, and it aint easy- Just a bit more expensive than it has a right to be, IMO. But what the hay, it's Vegas, a town where you can blow a 5-star dinner for one in cash just waiting to be seated.- You can't specifically reserve one of those awesome view tables. (On the pro side, $20 in the palm of the maitre 'd would probably get it done if you can wait a hot minute.)One thing that's a little weird is that the elevator to the restaurant deposits you in a waiting area right off the kitchen. This is a little odd, but gives you a chance to get a smell of what you're in for, and plant a seed of doubt in your mind that will be removed as soon as you see the stunning view from the dining room.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

While we did get a nice table on the window, that's about where the experienced ceased, our watier was awful, was not attentive at all - never topped up our water let alone take another drink order, we sat on the same overpriced drink we got at the bar on arrival also he did now know his menu at all - hopeless. Paid a fortune for something quite average. We returned some years later to give it another go and to be honest not much had changed , still a nice view but poor service and food that is bland. Save your money and try somewhere else, perhaps at the Bellagio -if you want a fountain view with Dinner.</review><polarity>-1</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

I knew the restaurant was expensive but it was a special occasion. I pre-arranged a window table weeks in advance so that we could have views of the nighttime Las Vegas skyline. The table happened to overlook the Bellagio fountains (which I would recommend) since they go off regularly with a light show.If you don't like French food at all then you will be disappointed. You can certainly stay with a steak and be fine but you won't enjoy many of the choices available.I chose the prix fixe menu which allowed me to have smaller portions of many of the chef's specialties.I'm glad that I did because they were all terrific and I was completely full at the end.Not so full that we didn't choose the grand marnier soufle for dessert...The tables are very close together but you do not feel overcrowded. It is not very noisy so you can have an intimate dinner with outdoor entertainment with a window table.The service is terrific and the food is excellent.If you can afford a pricey night out - this is a worthy selection if you are in Las Vegas.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Was told we would have to make this request upon arrival. Arrived and told they only had tables for 4 with the window view. Seems they could have told us this when the reservation was made. The young lady who greeted (poor choice of words) us didn't even look us in the face, much less greet us. We were seated promptly, waited about 10 minutes before anyone showed up...they quickly gave us a wine list. Now I understand their promptness with the wine list. This is where it became interesting. Big wine list - but probably not a dozen bottles under $100...plenty in the hundreds + of dollars. Ordered wine and cocktails...received the wine fairly promptly but 30 minutes later I had to ask about them about the cocktails. The food - very good, but inconsistent in some areas. At these prices, everything should have been outstanding...it wasn't. Service picked up after we started drinking wine...imagine that. At their prices, I would be pushing wine too. Everyone knows Las Vegas food in general is expensive (and over-priced), however, if you want to spend this kind of money, there are a lot of better options.</review><polarity>-1</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

Service very good but not the best we've ever had and for the price we expected a little more. Nice touches were the complementary chocolates at the end of the meal and the view we eventually got from the table. The views are impressive and hard to beat for an restaurant in Vegas. Small point of annoyance was an over charge for a shot of brandy, when we were asked why we were charged more than the menu stated, we were told it was cheaper to have the brandy with a mixer??

The view was great, overlooking the Bellagio Fountains and the south end of the strip. Service was good, waiters were all very polite. We found our French waiter to be ever so slightly "snooty" but really not a complaint. Just an air about him. Didn't diminish the level of service, though. The menu is definitely french, and slightly pretentious. Lots of elements of the dishes that have fancy names that many people wouldn't understand, and may feel self conscious asking about. Overall, it was an expensive dinner that we weren't sure was quite worth it. We've had just as good steak dinners for slightly less.That said, the meal was good. The mushroom soup was very nice, and the filet with red wine sauce was really tender and delicious. My husband's surf and turf was good, but the steak didn't seem as seared and "yummy" looking as my filet. The lobster was small - hefty price for a fairly small plate of surf and turf. The crowning glory was dessert... we both had the souffle (chocolate and the caramel) and wow! Delish! Really an excellent end to a good meal.My one beef with the restaurant is their "dress code". When making reservations we were told that no jeans were allowed - to be proper attire for men and ladies, etc. Well, before heading up for dinner, we noticed other couples going ahead of us that were wearing jeans, and somewhat casual dress. Many folks, men especially, in the restaurant were wearing jeans. That really rubs me the wrong way - why specify a dress code if you're not going to enforce it?And being that most folks are doing a lot of walking through Vegas, you'd expect people to be dressed comfortably in jeans and running shoes perhaps. So why make a point of telling some to come dressed appropriately for dinner, then allow others to wear 'whatever'?</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Had a window table which was nice but I feel I should mention this restaurant is NOT at the top of the tower. It's really only 3 stories up from ground level. View is ok but not worth the overpriced food. Dinner was average, not great, not bad (not worth $56 for a steak). Service was good but you'd expect it to be when they have a chance at 20% of huge bills. Atmosphere was very loud as the bar area is not separated from the restaurant and a lot of people come up just for a drink and the view (I.e. rowdy businessmen). All in all, would not go back. Eat downstairs at Mon Ami Gabi instead. Food is 1/3 of the price and twice as good. View is also better.</review><polarity>-1</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

The waiter was amazing and said he would try to accommodate, just as a new couple arrived at a 4 table seating area at the window. I requested a manager who informed me they did not accept reservations at the window. I politely thank him and walked away. He then said he 'found' a table and I refused. The dinner ended with the waiter wanting to bring a complimentary dessert, that I again refused as we were not expecting a handout. We spent well over $500 on dinner, and did not need or expect a consolation prize for what we expected from the evening.

Never had that happen before but it was great seeing all the chefs at work.Even though the place was full, we never felt rushed at any point. What a treat - and what a fine restaurant. I'd go back in a flash!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Unfortunately, we could not get the right time on Valentine's Day evening, so we reserved for the night before Valentine's.Just like the last time, we were greeted at the ground floor of the Paris, and then took the elevator to the 11th floor where you pass by a view of the chefs in the kitchen as you go to the reception desk. We had arrived early for our dinner reservation, so we waited at the bar - and it was a very pleasant wait! It's a beautiful bar with a view of the Strip. The bartender was pleasant and quick to get our drinks. I would recommend a French Martini to get you in the mood for the dinner! Expect your drinks to be in the $15-$20 range.Our table was ready right on time, and once again we were brought to the table I had requested - right at the window with a good view of the Bellagio fountains and the Vegas Strip at night. It was a small, half-round table, but plenty of room for the two of us, and very romantic!For the appetizer, we both ordered the roasted Foie Gras, which was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. We savored every bite! For the main course I had the Lamp, and my wife had the Short Ribs. Both were absolutely delicious and cooked perfectly, but if there was a contest between entrees, the Lamb would once again have won. We didn't order any side dishes this time, as the entree itself is more than enough to leave you satisfied.If we ordered anything more, it would have been far too much food. As it was, we really didn't have room to try the deserts. If you want the desert, I would suggest to skip the side dishes. The total for the dinner came to $242.00, including a martini and champagne for the both of us - not bad at all for such an amazing meal.Everything about this dinner was perfect, and as I stated last time, we'll definitely be going back to the Eiffel Tower again!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

I had parmasam chicken which was nice and spicy lamb burger which was delicious. For desert we had creme brûlée and apple strudel. I would recommend booking early and say its for a special occasion so they accommodate a good table.The only down side was our waiter had black teeth which really need seeing to as it put me off ordering for a split second! Plus at the end a group of waiters were talking about people giving them tips and being derogatory which I find tasteless, I know people come here for a special occasion and not everyone can afford giving 50 dollar tips, they should be grateful whatever people give them not taking the Micky, they should choose a time and place to do that not infront of customers on a late lunch.However, food and views where great.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The attention to detail is wonderful not only to watch but to taste as this was a wonderful taste experience.The view was also magnificent except you couldn't get the bellagio fountain music in the restaurant to see the theme of the show. The only suggestion I would have for the experience is to have softer French music playing. During our meal, the music was abstract and diverse and just a tad too loud ... Maybe we were located too close to the speakers but I don't recall.An excellent dining experience.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The food, what little there was of it was EXCELLENT. Having said that, I now know why the bread service came around three times while we waited on our entree. You better fill up on bread, or you will leave hungry after paying anywhere from $42 - $90 for your entree. Salads and sides will cost you extra at $18 for a salad and $10 for each side. The sides are not nearly as generous as you get at Ruth Chris or Morton's so sharing is not really an option. The service was impeccable and the view was great, but the experience unfortunately was not worth the price.442</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The drinks ate pricey but thos is in all restaurants in vegas.One of the couples was celebrating their anniversary and the kitchen sent out 2 lovely complimentary desserts with the plates personalised to their occasion which was a lovely touch.The attention to detail was fantastic and we felt like we had a really attentive night.Although it may cost a bit more than some restaurants it was money well spent on a memorable last night in Vegas.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Yes, the prices are extremely high, but not out-of-line with other top-notch restaurants. And, most people drop that kind of money in the slots or at a gaming table in less time than it took to eat the meal.Our party of 6 enjoyed advice and recommendations from the waiter for the evening, John Paul. You must order a soufflé before you eat, if you want one, so it will be ready when you are finished. There are many flavors and the soufflés are big so unless you’re a piggy, plan on sharing. We started our meal with a bottle of chardonnay and a tiny cup of cold cauliflower and bacon soup. Then, on to fresh breads, which we enjoyed entirely too much. We split two of the scallop appetizers, most of us wishing for more of the savory treats. We ordered the delicious creamy soups. I selected the creamy French Onion. Yum! Red wine accompanied the rest of our meal. When our main courses arrived, the smells alone were delicious. We ordered two of the vegetables to share which was plenty for most of us. The portions and servings were a bit puzzling to me though since I had Beef Wellington and lots of fresh peas that were more than enough. Yet my daughter had one little part of a boned duck with nothing else. The Beef Wellington is wrapped with fantastic dough that is too good not to finish. The pies de resistance soufflés arrived warm. John Paul tapped a hole in the top of each and added hot fudge to the chocolate soufflé and hot caramel to the caramel. By then end of our feast, no one could complain about not having enough to eat. We were extremely satisfied and glad we could walk some of our dinner off on the way back to our hotel.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The restaurant was very noisy and busy so we had to talk loudly to be heard. The views were good, but we were a few tables back from the window to fully appreciate it. The food descriptions were poor and I had to send mine back as it contained an ingredient I'm allergic to which was not mentioned on the menu or by the waiter when I had asked him. Won't go back - think there are better places on vegas.</review><polarity>-1</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

We were seated at a window overlooking the Bellagio Fountains, which added to the already beautiful atmosphere.This restaurant runs like a well-oiled machine. We were seated promptly, greeted by our waiter immediately, who took our drink order and left us to browse the menu. He answered all our questions, and was cheerful and gracious. He seemed to anticipate our needs and it seemed he was at our table almost as we thought of seeking him out!The food was amazing! Attention to detail in the preparation and presentation of each dish was evident. Everything looked beautiful - and tasted wonderful. My son had the salmon and he said it seemed like it melted in his mouth. My lamb was equally mouth-watering. My husband would have liked his filet mignon a little less red in the centre, but he said it was too delicious to return!The only thing that caused me to raise an eyebrow is that when you step off the elevator at the restaurant, you feel like you are entering through the kitchen. There is a hostess there to greet you (I suspect this entry has caused confusion in the past), but I think that for such a "high-end" restaurant, the kitchen should not be your first view.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

I try to make choices with some informed decisions and in the case of Sin City, I knew that if I made a bit of extra effort cross-referencing reviews and articles online, on Trip Advisor, and in my 2013 Fodor's guide that I would produce some good results. This restaurant made it in my top 5 choices and it surpassed every expectation. We went with another couple who was relying on my 'research' and they were blown away as much as we were. We knew that dining in the evenings was going to be expensive(ish) (depending where you eat!) and we wanted to make every dollar count.Location: pretty unique - in the middle of the scaled down version of the Eiffel Tower, it offers a fantastic view of the strip and specifically the Bellagio fountains across the street, which popping up every 30 minutes makes for a magical backdrop while you are dining. We were sitting in the upper tier of tables and still had a decent view of the fountains and the city beyond. Service: Outstanding. A full fine-dining experience. The sommelier, which was summoned after we had made a few inquiries, had extensive knowledge. When my selection of wine by the glass had run out mid-dinner the sommelier made a selection of two alternative wines for me to try, both were brought to me for tasting and both were excellent substitutions (even better than what I had originally selected!) The staff from start to finish were extremely polite, courteous and had all been trained very well. Food: Wow. I had the Cream of Mushrooms, Wild Rice Galette, Crispy Shallots and the Char Broiled Filet Mignon, Béarnaise; I also sampled a few other things at the table and they were all delicious. One of our friends ordered the sorbets presented on a painters palette - very original and delicious. I can't imagine anything on the menu would have been anything but excellent.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We had a superb view from our table in the glassed corner. Our waiter, Todd was great, as was his assistant. Todd's suggestions were spot on. He was prompt and professional. We waited for nothing... The food was the best we have had during our stay in Vegas. We are here on an extended stay and are trying all levels of restaurants. Some have been outstanding and this is the top of the list. Servers have also been all levels and Todd is by far the best waitperson we have had during our stay. He and his assistant were seamless in their attention. We cannot wait to return. EXCEPTThe one thing that bothers us is that although we would love to return and are more than happy to make a reservation, I do not care to give my credit card to hold a reservation. We would like to return for our anniversary in a couple of weeks but...We did not need a reservation for lunch today yet to make a lunch OR dinner reservation on line I have to provide a CC number. Again both the food and the sevice was the BEST in Vegas. Thank you Todd for making our lunch a very memorable experience.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

I think if you book 24 hours in advance you get fountain seats automatically which is great :)Now the foodBread and butter = cold tasteless and boringStarter = belly pork = very nice on a bed of tasty lentils but I have had better.Mandys starter = warm foi gras = not quite warm enough but very still very niceMain course = fillet steak Rossini with foi gras and Mandy had lamb cutlets. My steak was cooked medium rare and was perfect the foi gras certainly added that certain extra melt in the mouth touch but the crouton base was awful :( now maybe it's Vegas as I've now had 2 ceased salads and both these came with awful croutons. We also shared brussel sprouts, spinach and potatoes. The sprouts where hard and unedible for me the spinach came in a chesnut creamy sauce which made the spinach really good :) now the best thing I ate tonight was a tase of mandys lamb chops, they where the tastiest bit of lamb ever ! Very pink in fact red but they melted in your mouth :) we didn't bother with a sweet but Mandy had just half a bottle of Pinot Gris. The total bill was $300 including a $29 tip but we did pay $ 40 pre dinner for 2 drinks in the bar. I was once again left feeling it just wasn't good enough for the money and yet I would recommend the place just keep off the sprouts !! I would say best place so far on my Vegas trip to take someone for a romantic meal x</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

YES, 25 June !!! And I specifically requested a window table overlooking the Bellagio water show. We reviewed their menu and wine list online prior to leaving Australia, and were expecting to spend in the vicinity of US$600 as there were some special wines my husband was going to try. We arrived early for pre-dinner drinks at the bar and the restaurant was packed. I introduced myself to Lyle Tolhurst and discussed looking forward to a fabulous night of dining overlooking the water show. Our booking was for 8:00pm and after enjoying a couple of expensive cocktails at the bar, at 8:40pm we were shown to a terrible table stuck in a corner with no view of the water show and one of us would have been looking at a wall. As this was my special gift to my husband for Christmas, I was devasted.....!!! My husband could see I was visibily upset, and after speaking with the apologetic female Maitre d', we were passed on to Lyle Tolhurst who attempted to appease us by taking us downstairs to the Mon Ami Gabi restaurant. This was not a compromise for us as we had already patronised MAG previously for a luncheon - and we had been anticipating a fine dining experience. It was now after 9:00pm and we decided we would look elsewhere. Lyle Tolhurst's parting words to us was "Sorry we spoilt your Christmas Dinner"..................... NOT GOOD ENOUGH LYLE!!!!!!</review><polarity>-1</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

When we arrived, we were able to enjoy a drink at the bar first before being shown to our table which was seated at the window, directly opposite the Bellagio fountains. This meant that every 15 minutes from 8pm onwards we were able to enjoy the wonderful sights while enjoying our meal.The restaurant only offered a set menu on New Years Eve however I found it to have some lovely options. All courses were wonderfully presented and all met our expectations.Although obviously pricey, it was an excellent experience and a great way to start New Years celebrations.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

This time, not so much. We arrived a bit early for our reservation and were seated promptly in front of the window, but then we were left there for a long time without seeing a waiter, without menus and without being offered a cocktail. The waitress then gave us menus and sent the sommelier to our table before we had any idea what we wanted to eat, so we had to send him away and ask him to return once we had decided on an order. The waiter then returned and asked us if we had questions on the menu, but still did not offer to take a cocktail order. After we asked to whom we were supposed to give our order, the waiter finally took one down for us. The appetizers were quite good, as were the wines recommended by the sommelier, but the individual beef wellingtons disappointed our dining companions, who remembered them as being remarkable on a past visit. The waitstaff seemed confounded by the slow pace at which we preferred to eat so that we could have a leisurely meal with good conversation, and actually cleared some of our plates while leaving others on the table - faux pas! While the meal was "good", it certainly did not hold up to our expectations. Order the foie gras or the blue cheese souffle, skip the escargot and the beef wellington. Don't skip the side dishes - entrees are served without vegetables or potato, so you have to order those on the side to complete your meal.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

One of the more costly meals in my lifetime but worth the price paid. At the end of the second course, we felt the dinner was moving along too quickly. I asked the waiter to slow down the pace, and he obliged so we could spend plenty of time taking in the Bellagio fountains at sunset, watching the casinos light up as we stared transfixed at the beauty of Las Vegas and the beauty of each other, quietly holding hands under the table, engaging in fun conversation about us, each other, life, and so many things. Sometimes a dining experience is positive because the food is excellent (as was the case with the Lamb - wow), but what I strongly recall as I compose this review a week later is how the meal facilitated a romantic interlude. It also facilitated a marriage proposal at the table next to us. I recommend this place even more so for those who are in love or want to fall in love.

We were seated promptly at a window seat that had only a very partial view of the Bellagio fountains. Our main view was of the Arc de Triomphe and the southern strip, which was nice, but could have been better. That was our only slight disappointment of the night. Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable and attended to our every need. The food was excellent, the lamb and the filet are recommended. Our waiter was also courteous enough to give us a complete list of his personal favorite night clubs and things to do while in Vegas. The photo opportunity was an excellent addition to this experience. Overall a great romantic meal and yes it is pricey, but that was expected.

I visit Vegas yearly with my mom and sister, but this was never an option as I viewed this to be a romantic experience. This was not the case however; there were groups of women and even parents who'd brought a child along.I had the surf and turf which was outstanding. Excellent presentation and delicious. DH had a steak which he enjoyed very much. We both had the mushroom soup for a starter, which was amazing. They brought the bowl with a wild rice-filled stuffed mushroom in the center, then brought over the pot containing the soup and poured in a generous amount. Delicious!For dessert, soufflé was excellent. Because we were celebrating our anniversary, our server also brought a chocolate mousse with a decorated plate for the occasion. Again, delicious.My only negative was we felt a bit pressured on the up sells. Did I want more wine, did we want 2 desserts, did we want additional sides... I was told there was a very small amount of potato with my dinner, but in reality it would have been more than sufficient. Instead, I ordered the potato fingerlets--like fried mashed potato sticks. These were fine, but didn't seem to fit the ambience. We also ordered the mushroom spaetzle which was terrific. I should add there was plenty of bread offered. Phenomenal baguettes!Definitely recommend booking through open table, at a 5 or 5:15 reservation which guarantees a window table. We overlooked the bellagio fountains and watched the sun set over the mountains. Just perfect. Well worth the splurge!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The food was excellent. Many tried and true listings and some excellent unique offerings. The view of the Bellagio Fountains was beautiful. We had 5:15 reservations on a Saturday which is usually early for us but the hostess suggested we come early so that we would be assured of a window seat. I actually think in retrospect it was a very good choice because we were able to have a differnt view going from dusk to dark.

Took my wife here for an Anniversary celebration and WOW did we hit a jackpot here (in fact the only win I had all weekend LOL). When i made my reservation I told them we were celebrating our anniversary From the moment we arrived the staff made our night one to remember. Little things like rose petals on the table to a window seat overlooking the fountains at Bellagio were just the beginning. The menu was loaded with so many excellent choices, one hardly could make up one's mind. I had the Short Ribs (5 stars) my wife had the duck (5 more stars). Everything was well prepared and delicious. Our waiter Igor was very helpful in suggestions as we navigated the menu. He was extremely attentive, yet not annoying in fact the entire staff was first rate. I will definitely dine here again. Guys if you want to treat that special lady in your life take her here. As some else mentioned your first thought is that you are paying for the view, totally not the case the view is just a throw in, the FOOD and Service is the star.

I called and was told these seats were on a first come, first served basis so we need to arrive as close to 5pm when it opened as possible and we would have no problem. We arrived at 5.10pm and were told by the lady on the desk that unfortunately we could not have window seats as they have all gone. We weren't happy and when we were seated we noticed most of these window tables were for 2 so were were misled originally that there was ever a chance. The waiter Joseph was extremely courteous and helpful. The food was very expensive as I had anticipated but when I only ate half my chicken dish as it was ony warm when it arrived, it was taken away without anyone asking us all night how we enjoyed our food or was my meal to my liking when it was only half eaten. The lights were lovely but I could eat on Sydney Harbour waterfront on New Years Eve with the best light show in the world for less money and get the window seat I booked. I would not recommend this restaurant.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We were slightly apprehensive that we were falling into a tacky tourist trap. After all, it is a restaurant in a fake Eiffel tower in the middle of Las Vegas. You can't get more novelty factor than that. The prices are mid to high range (for us), and we thought it was probably purely due to the location rather than the quality of the restaurant. But we figured it would be fun. We booked the restaurant while on the casino floor. The lady at the ETR podium was a little crazy but good fun. We spent a little time explaining we were from near London, and also from England. After that hurdle, she was keen to find out all about Prince Harry.Upon arriving for our meal, we asked for a window seat and explained we didn't mind waiting. The Hostess told us to grab a drink and she would get us when a table was available. Perfect. The table we had was fantastic! right in the middle of the fountains overlooking the strip. The waiter was slightly intense, but very professional. The wine list is one of the longest I've ever browsed. It's almost ridiculous. But I'm sure you can get exactly what you want, regardless of who particular you may be. The whole experience was lovely, but the the food exceeded our expectations by the long way. It helps that the menu was to my liking, but the execution was just perfect. My girlfriend had the Salmon, and i had the lamb rack. Both were a step above most restaurants. It seems they have not got caught up in trying to be too innovative, but deliver flawless classics. To finish we had the soufflés, which were also fantastic. I would recommend the ETR to anyone. I will be visiting again.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We wanted something nice, but also a Vegas thing, so this restaurant seemed like the thing to do. The ambiance is very nice, great views of the Bellagio Fountains, and the Strip. Decor is very nice as well. Our food was very good and very french. My partner, being from France, said his plate was exactly what he ate at home for Christmas, and he said it was delicious. I tried it, but did not love the polenta, thought it was very bland. I dont eat meat so I didnt try his lambchops, but he said they were great. For appetizers I had the blue cheese mouse, which was FENOMENAL. As a main dish I had the salmon, which was good, but did not come with any sides. I ordered some potato things as a side and my partner ordered another thing......they were both something out of Denny's......fried, over creamy, fatty........nothing to do with the upscale menu of the restaruant. My son had a kids meal.....great that they have kids meals at a place like this........chicken and fries. It was, well, a kids meal. Wine selection was great, but of course, be prepared to pay 15 dollars for a glass of wine. Our bill for 2 adults and one child was $250 dollars with no dessert, and 3 glasses of wine. If you look past the setting and ambiance, this is just a place with overpriced good food. In New York or even Vegas, you can find better food at more reasonable prices. We had a good time here, and I would say it was a good pick for Christmas Eve, but I would not return.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

You take a short elevator ride to a restaurant that overlooks the Bellagio water show. Hold out for a table next to the window. It is worth the wait. This is a very romantic restaurant that has an excellent bar and the food was wonderful. We both had filet mignon with sides of mushrooms and au gratin potatoes. The confused our steak order so it took a few minutes longer to get our meal but the waiter gave us complimentary dessert so all was forgiven.

We were not rushed to leave the table and ended up sitting there for 3 hours.

The restaurant delivered.The elevator does open out to a corridor by the kitchen, so you can see the chefs at work, which I think shows a confidence about the place. The restaurant is quite a big space, was clean and does truly have a wonderful view.We arrived early as we wanted to see the restaurant and make sure we got a table on time, so we let the host know we had arrived and she checked our reservation and agreed to get us at the bar. Bang on 8:30 she came and got us as promised. Great start.We got a table for two up against the glass which was what we wanted, the restaurant has an awesome view. There are only tables of two up near the windows, but the rest of the place is on levels, so from what I can tell you should get a view from anywhere. The waiter was friendly and very knowledgeable, drinks or rolls were always on offer for refills, was a great service experience. First we were given an amuse bouche which was cream of cauliflower, which was nice and a bread of our choice, a solid selection. For starter I had the blue cheese soufflé which was excellent, the cheese not as overpowering as I was expecting, which made it seem nicer. My wife had mushroom soup, which was also very tasty, two fantastic starters. For my main I had the Beef Wellington and my wife had the salmon. We also ordered a creamed spinach and potato gratin. Now the Beef was fantastic, I would honestly say it was one of the nicest meals I’ve had. The salmon was also very good both well worth having. Still I’d have the beef any time, and when I’m next in town, I’ll be booking this restaurant, and I’ll be having wellington. We didn’t actually eat both the sides, I thought the Gratin could’ve come out hotter, that is the only negative aspect of our meal. It was very nice tasting though, it was very rich which is another reason, why we didn’t finish it. The creamed spinach was also very good, also quite rich, but did taste exquisite. After the meal we were to full for dessert, so I can’t really say what they’re like, we were given a little chocolate treat after the meal, which was very nice. The bill for us which was 2 starters 2 mains a coke and bottle of coke plus a tip was $200, and to be honest I thought the meal and the overall dining experience justified that cost. We’ll definitely head back to the Eiffel tower restaurant next time we’re in town.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

It was just a fabulous time and the food was wonderful. The view over the Bellagio Fountains was just breath taking. I recommend going at night because the fountains don't start until 3 pm. The view is beautiful but once the fountains start the experience takes on an entirely different feel. The French Toast was too die for. The only thing I didn't understand was the dress code. We dressed up for the occasion but a few others were in torn jeans. Thought the other diners should have followed the set rules. But I guess there wasn't much the staff could do. I did appreciate the nice photographer that came around and took our picture. Usually don't go for those but she let us see the picture and it was a really nice shot with the Bellagio and fountains in the background. It was the best deal in town at $10.

Our wait staff did a wonderful job of catering to us and it is fun to enjoy the service and atmosphere.The wine selection is what you would expect in this type of place - but the prices were higher than most. We are wine drinkers and their list, while impressive, leaves little option for those who don't want to blow their budget on drink. But you can enjoy some great wines if you are willing to drop some $$$$. We enjoyed all our selections very much and the staff is well versed in the options.The Cold Pate and Creamed Spinach with mushroom are out of this world. The salads were just OK - we had both the Mixed and Ceaser. The Pheasant is good but nothing special to recommend. We did have the Chocolate Souffle and were not disappointed.If you have the budget and the time I think it is worth a trip for the experience since you don't find many restaurants like this anymore. You may think the food beyond belief - as it is always a matter of taste.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

I've had way better meals for less money. Be ready to spend more than $100 dlls per person, plus drinks and gratuities.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The meet and greet was a bit perfunctory and we were told to sit at the bar until the table was ready. My son didn't have time to get a drink before we were summonsed to the table. It was an excellent spot to see the Bellagio Fountains but the table was cramped and we were cheek to jowl with the couples sitting either side. I made it known I had gluten and alcohol allergies and asked for advice on what I may eat from the menu. I felt I was putting my server out by asking this question. He was very brusque and unhelpful and grudgingly found out what I may have. The meal was passable but certainly not worth the $200+ price tag (without alcoholic drinks remember). Presentation was poor (my son's boeuf Wellington looked like a steak pie!) and we were made to feel rushed (we were dining early because we were seeing a show) presumably so they could fit one one else in. Sorry, but I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

But seriously, the food is average and whilst the service is very good (there are more waiters than any other restaurant I have eaten at) there are so many people eating here, it is hard to feel special. The food is some of the most expensive I have ever encountered. When you are paying $60+ for a steak, you are crazy or have won big time on the pokies down stairs. Not to mention the compulsory 18% gratuity which was added to the bill without notification. If you want great food, try a place without a view...that is the golden rule. By the way, there is an attendant in the restrooms who expects a tip.</review><polarity>0</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

From the moment we arrived at our window seat overlooking the Bellagio fountains the service was of sterling quality, and not overbearing or intimidating as can happen in some higher end restaurants. The service staff catered to all our needs without misssing a beat and was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. The food was very authentic French. We were impressed that the menu offered such variety. They were serving from the new Winter menu that included a stupendous mushroom soup and short ribs that melted in your mouth. The soufles are great.Even the cocktails were exceptional. We had a classic Old-Fashioned with 3 crushed cherries that can't compare to even the most well known bars. As a same sex couple we received the royal treatment in this most romantic of rooms with a view to rival Times Square. We were so moved by the experience that we had a romantic kiss while watching the dancing water fountains across the street. Defintely welcoming to LGBT couples.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The food is spot on, but the service is what makes this the best dining option on the Strip. Yes, I said the service. Remember great service? Remember the kind of service you would kill to tip for? I am sure all of their staff is great, but we have always been indulged by John Paul DaLuz. And it has always been as great as great service can get. If he is busy ask to be sat with a lovely young lady named Allison. We watched her care of a table next to us and she was nothing short of perfect, as well.Like I said, the food is spot on French cuisine. The somelier Joe is an expert of pairing your meal with the perfect libation. Just tell him your price range and he is excite your palate. For an after dinner treat, maybe he will let you have some of the very rate PX sherry they have.If you are looking for the strip's best meal and magnificent view, then The Eiffel Tower is the place. All during dinner you are entertained by the dancing waters of the Bellagio fountains. They should be giving Bellagio some $$ for the entertainment. so get dressed up (there really isn't a dress code) and take your favorite gal out for the most romantic night on the town. BTW, when making your reservation, tell them it is a special romantic evening and ask for them to sprinkle rose pedals on the table. It is a free service and gals eat that up.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The food was good (not as good as the prices would suggest, but then you're supposed to be paying for an overall experience), and our personal waitress was lovely. However, another staff member clearly had three of her friends sat at the next table, and continually stood over us talking to them loudly about her plans for next week, whether she would have to work the next day, the discount she would be offering them, how they should visit her at her house on Tues, etc. etc. We put up with this for a good while as we didn't want to cause a fuss and her friends had already had dessert. Eventually though it became so distracting and noisy that my husband went to the manager to let him know what was happening. The manager agreed it was unacceptable and thanked my husband for the feedback. The situation only got worse as the restaurant emptied and the waitress was soon stood permently over us with her friends, who had long since finished their meal. We decided to hurry up and get the check as this was now very distracting and it was difficult to hold a conversation. Despite advising the manager of the problem, and the obvious way in which it had worsened, we were offered no discount. When I challenged this and objectively pointed out I was paying for a complete experience, which we had simply not had, he completely dismissed me and contradicted his previous comments to my husband by saying his staff member was clearly just having a good time, because 'this is Vegas'. Eventually he offered us $24 off a $374 bill for an evening we had not been allowed to experience properly. The restaurant, and particularly the manager, needs to rethink the way it conducts itself in the context of the prices it charges. We felt completely ripped off, disregarded and left feeling rather sad about the way the experience had turned out.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Over the course of a week of our stay we ate at Diablos, Stack, Julian Serrano, Mon Ami Gabi, Maggiano's, BLT burger and Fatburger. All really good for different reasons. Vegas really does have a wide variety of great food in all price ranges. I happened to pick 1/2 of my choices based on reviews from this site. They were fairly accurate to the overall rating.

We walked out of the restaurant at 7:45 p.m. 2 had the winter greens with roasted beets, 1 caeser salad and 1 mushroom soup. The winter greens and mushroom soup were outstanding. The caesar was described as"different". But no complaints were voiced. Entrees ordered were the filet with red wine sauce, venison chop, salmon, and beef wellington. Each one was expertly prepared and beautifully presented. The sides of scalloped potatoes, asparagus and green beans matched the quality of the entrees.Besides an complimentary chocolate mousse for our birthday girl (see other photos posted in previous reviews) we ordered the creme brulee. Fabulous ending to a memorable meal.The staff was exemplary. Several have noted that the hosts/hostess were rude or inefficient. We had placed a reservation several weeks before our trip and made mention of our show tickets/time. Since we were seated promptly, we had minimal contact with this part of the house. Our waiter was one of the best we have ever had. Quietly efficient and respectful. Seamless service of all courses. Charming. I so wish we had remembered his name. He deserves high praise. The other suppport staff was just as qualified. We haven't experienced such competent wait staff in years. Their training shines through.The one complaint from all four in our party was the lack of dress code enforcement. This venue deserves better. There is a desk at the elevator that could easily address the issue before patrons walk into the restaurant. We rarely spend this much on dinner. At these prices one does not want to be disappointed. The Eiffel Tower is memorable in every way. Enjoy the spectacular views, indulgent cuisine, and attentive staff. It is a worthy experience for all the senses.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

After about 10 minutes the waiter came and informed us of an accident in the kitchen and our mains had to be re done ,we were then presented with a course off the taster menu to tide us over by way of an apology from the chef.The mains came and again were fantastic, we were surprised however by the portions all being larger than expected.Dessert was Souffle for us all, again first class.Wine was a little on the expensive side but the quality of the food more than made up for it.As I had mentioned my birthday on booking another sweet course arrived for me beautifully presented followed by a variety of sorbets again complimentary.Staff were attentive and friendly, overall one of the best ever dinning experiences I have had.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The hosts at the entrance to the elevator sent us right up. When we approached the hosts on the restaurant floor we were told that we would be seated closer to 8pm and to go set in the bar or in their waiting area. Didn't like the way they talked to us but OK. The proper way would've been to say your table isn't ready or were waiting for a window seat to open for you. A lot better way to tell your customer that there's going to be a wait. I rack this up to lack of training of the staff. While waiting we noticed that even though they have a dress code it isn't enforced. NOT EVEN CLOSE!!! There were people that came in dirty jeans, Tee shirts and pants that didn't come close to falling under their dress code. At 15 minutes after our reservation time and people that walked up were being seated I again went up to the host stand and asked about our table. I was told in an indigent tone that our table wasn't ready. I really dislike being talked down to by hosts. I told the three of them that I hoped that it would be soon otherwise I would be talking to the Manager and they weren't going to be happy with the outcome. We were seated within two minutes at a window table. Our waiter came up to us and said they had been waiting on us. Our table had been waiting for about 15 minutes. I had ordered Roses for my wife and had seen them delivered to the table.Once we were seated things changed 180 degrees. Our waiter was great!!! The food was great!!! and we had a great time!!! The fail with this night were the three young people that were acting as hosts on the restaurant floor. They need to be retrained. People that spend big money for a meal don't like to be talked down to.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

My sister and I had made reservations and were assured that we'd have an excellent view of the fountains across the street. We were stuck at a table all the way down to the end, and sat for awhile watching couples be seated at the good tables. I spoke to the waiter, who called the maitre D and I asked him if we had to be men to get a good table. We were given a better table but the food was not good - the steak and lobster combo was $100. for the 2 of us and we didn't even get a whole lobster tail ! It was a tail sliced into halfs or possibly fourths. My advice is to avoid it - eat downstairs - the food was fabulous, the prices were reasonable, the ambiance is delightful and the servers were very pleasant and efficient.</review><polarity>-1</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

The view across to the Bellagio is fantastic.....but that is the only thing that was excellent.We elected to do the Chef's Tasting Menu and while nothing was bad, there was also nothing that stood out as being truly fantastic. They were accommodating with a request to change a course which we appreciated. The service was also good, but not great. They are definitely not 5 star dining but yet still charge the same exorbitant prices. $600 for two is a bit much for an slightly above average dinner. For that kind of price we expect to be wow'ed like at Picasso, Cirque, SW, etc.</review><polarity>0</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

I would definitely order any one of them again. They were the cold foie gras, the pork belly (with French lentils), and the escargots and sweetbreads. Yummmm! My husband's salmon looked and tasted divine. I had two little girls with me, so they split the chicken. Even that was scrumptious. Yes, it is expensive, so budget accordingly. We were a party of 6 and managed to get away with a bill that was a little over 300 (we didn't drink). The view is nice; I wasn't blown away. The music (American jazz) was great. The main negative was that the waitstaff seemed oddly stressed (it was 2 in the afternoon). And our waitress only addressed me, not the two other men at the table with me. Odd. But, overall, wonderful.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

It is a unique location to have a romance dinner where we can look out the city at night. - Food: it is HAUNTE CUISINE means it is served in small courses. Honestly, I felt full after dinner at the restaurant. Foods are authentic and taste good. - Services: good services. Waiter and waitress are well-trained and professional. Unlike: - Price: You pay what you get. So obviously, it's expensive. If you are a budget traveller, don't consider this place. Totally, we paid $300 for dinner of 2. We had cocktail, appetizers, main courses and desert. I think it's worth ! Some tips:- Haute cuisine. Don't expect to be full :) - Dress up. Semi-formal and business attire - Make reservation to have a nice view - Expect to pay at least $100 per person for dinner - Cannot go wrong withToasted Salmon for main-course - Enjoy as much as possible !</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Ok, first off, when you get there, ask for a window seat so you can see the Bellagio fountains. It may take a few extra minutes, but it is worth it. here is the biggest hint, if you arrive at least 30 minutes before your reservations, you can sit at the wonderful bar while you wait. The reason for doing this is that it almost assures you of getting a window table.I asked our server if it was possible to get a shrimp cocktail (not on the menu), not a problem, it was served chilled with the other salads. Bread is beinig served all the time, but don't fill up on it. My companion's filet w/ bernaise was wonderful. we shared the potatoes au gratin and green beans almondine. My steak however had a problem. I ordered medium, the deep inside of the steak (they are very thick), was on the rare side of medium rare. Simple fix, ask them to butterfly it for you, I am pretty sure they would.As our order was being taken, my companion ordered the Chocolate Mousse for dessert (30 minute prep time) that was being offered as a special. I went for the warm apple strudel. It took over an hour for these desserts to get to our table after we had finished out main course. That is unacceptable for any kitchen. Even before they came, our server had told us they were being comped due to the time involved. When they did get there, the chocolate mousse had mysteriously transfomed intsself into the the chocolate souffle and the warm apple strudel had cooked too long and a knife was necessary to cut through the bottom of the crust. The other bad thing is that while we were waiting for the dessert, I ordered an adult beverage. What I ordered and what what arrived were two different things. A food/drink runner brought it, I drank part of it, the server noticed it was the wrong one and comped the right on, which he brought forthwith. However, it was so strong I could not drink more than a sip.Overall, a great experience, would I go there again? Maybe.</review><polarity>0</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

We went in the Paris hotel and looked at the menu for the restaurant. The lady offered to take us up and show us. The lift opens onto the working kitchen, which is interestinghaving taken in the view of the bellagio fountains and the strip we decided to book and asked for a window table. We were assured by the lady all table for 2 were at the window, but we couldnt book a specific table (we wanted the corner one)we arrived ten minutes early, it was chaos, the bar was busy it was noisy and raucous, just horrible. There were people waiting everywhere. we checked in and were told to go wait. there was no room at the bar and dozens of people waiting. there is absolutley no point expecting to get your table on time its just hit and misswe were standing getting jostled with about another 30 people, after waiting half hour we asked how much longer, to be told by a very unhelpful lady she didnt no and we just had to wait. Our table was booked for 8..we wanted 7.30 but there was no availibility. By 8.45 i had had anough of the noise and delay and was about to leave and go elswhere when we were seated....NOT at the windowthere was an empty window table opposite which we asked for to be told someone else had been waiting longer. they hadnt. We had specifically asked and been assured yet it seems that got ignoredThe food was good but we were fed up and wished we hadnt botheredThe wine was expensivewe had one course and left partly because it was an overal disappointment and partly because of the noise and partly as it was late and we wanted to see the brilliant duelling pianos on the bar downstairsI woudnt go back here, the waiter was very polite but the lady checking us in was rude. there is no system of order they dont stick to times and it was just a fiasco.on the way out we met a couple at the lift who had booked online months ago, they too had to wait nearly an hour and felt the food was ok but nothing special. the best thing about this restaurant is the view...and we didnt get the window</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Last evening we were guests of our daughter and her husband at Eiffel Tower. This was our third visit to the Eiffel Tower Restaurant. Despite my table request to the "could care less" staff person handling our check in at the restaurant we were seated in one of the more undesirable tables adjacent to the upper rail. Our server and her team did a very fine job and the food was excellent. The manager did not stop by our table until we asked the server if there was a manager on duty. The manager was not working the room in any way shape or form. He did not identify himself and came across as particularly snooty with a "could care less" attitude. He didn't give a whit if we were frequent diners or not or that our table request was totally disregarded. What a huge,huge difference between Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak and Stone Crab and the Eiffel Tower in so far as attitudes exist toward the restaurant patrons. For a quality organization, there is some real work needed at this location to bring the attitudes of every employee and management staff to the level of the great location and the outstanding food. Eiffel Tower clearly did not meet the level of our reasonable expectations and did not live up to the outstanding standards of the LEYE group of restaurants. Just a touch more of attention to the guest/patrons will make this restaurant the "real deal".</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

When we arrived at the restaurant we were met by two other ladies who we gave our name to and were told to wait at the bar. After two drinks at the bar and a 45 minute wait, my partner checked with the lady that we gave our names to, how much longer the wait would be. She advised him that we were next. After waiting over an hour and watching other people being seated before us I approached the lady and explained that she had told my partner we were next however at least three other groups had been seated. It was only at this point that she decided to advise me that we were the next on the ‘waiting list’ and that we would only get seated if there was a cancellation or a no-show. It was at this point that I told her to take us off the list and we left the restaurant – no apology or remorse from the lady. Obviously the restaurant was fully booked and the lady downstairs should never have sent us up in the first place, or should have at least warned us. However the next two ladies that we met in the restaurant continued to keep us in the dark, uninformed and allowed us to wait at the bar for over an hour without a single word from them – even though they knew we might not even get a seat for dinner. I am extremely angry at the low level of customer service that this restaurant offers. I have been to many first class restaurants and could never imagine being treated so rudely as we were here. For such a high priced menu, I would expect first class service, unfortunately that was not offered and I am left with a very negative outlook towards this restaurant. Go to Gordon Ramsey’s restaurant Steak instead – they will at least tell you they are fully booked for the night!</review><polarity>-1</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

I had booked the reservation two weeks earlier requesting a table overlooking the Bellagio fountains across the street. The restaurant was very very busy (Saturday night in Vegas no less!). Our reservation was for 6:30 pm and I had doubts about whether or not we would be seated on a timely basis as the bar was packed. We were promptly seated at 6:35 pm, which was very impressive! Our table was front and center looking over the fountains and down the strip with no one in front of us.Our waiter for the evening was John. He was excellent through the entire evening and answered all our questions.Started with a lobster salad and green salad which were very good.My wife and I both had filet mignon with two sides.My steak was excellent! My wife said her's was very good.The portions were of a good size for a fine dining establishment.The desserts were excellent as well.It is quite expensive but well worth the price for a special night out in Las Vegas. Our thanks to John and the rest of the staff for a great night out!!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Generally a very good, if expensive, experience. Luckily, we went early, about 6:30 pm, so we got a good table with a great view with no reservation and no wait. The nicest thing about the view is that it overlooks the Bellagio Hotel water show that that occurs every 15 minutes during the dinner hours. We decided to try the tasting menu with 6 small courses. Expensive, but tasted great and was well presented. With a half bottle of decent wine are bill was $300 plus for two. The service was pleasant and attentive,though somewhat overbearing at first to get you to buy expensive wine. Because of the cost, I wouldn't go here often, but for a special occasion with the view and the quality of the food it was worth a visit.</review><polarity>0</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

We went early in the evening and were seated near a window with a perfect view of the Bellagio fountains. The decor was plush with a lot of red velvet and comfy booths. They started us with a tiny serving (amuse bouche) of chilled cream of cauliflower soup which was excellent. Next came a variety of breads that were offered repeatedly throughout the meal. No stinting here. We tried all 4 types of bread, and all were excellent. Our entrees (the salmon and roasted chicken) were delicious. Desserts were to die for in terms of both taste and presentation. The creme brulee came in a huge bowl with fresh berries. The chocolate hazelnut cake was equally beautiful. We were very impressed! Highly recommended.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

I booked in advance and said it was a lunch before my wedding. The restaurant made an extra effort - reserving a great table and sprinkling with rose petals. The service was great and evn though we only had one course, we were not rushed and had time to enjoy a ladies lunch. I would love to return to try an evening meal on one of the window tables for 2. However, lunch is a great alternative if you just want to experience the view.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Well, the price might be part of the issue, but his is definitely a "big deal- worth it" kind of place.The food is excellent. While I have been places with more inventive menus in New York, Paris, San Fran, etc., the food is nothing that you will make at home, all supurbly prepared. We had excellent short ribs and pheasant as the mains -- I love pheasant and it did not disappoint. Starters were more inventive, even the salads.The wine this is extensive and well-selected. It's not cheap, but I know my wines and it is fairly priced. The sommelier can offer excellent advice.There is a tasting menu option, but we passed this time. Maybe next time.Of course, a big reason to come here is the great view over the Bellagio fountains across the street, and te other lights of Las Vegas. Tables for two seem to have the best option for views right up at the window; larger tables are set across the aisle, but still have great views.Hot tip: there is a bar here where you can come for a drink (and maybe more?) but still get the great views without going for the expensive dinner. It is still not a cheap place, but will not set you back as much.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Absolutely impressed by the views and our bartender Keith. We decided to make a reservation for dinner Saturday. Host was friendly and helpful. Ran into Keith again and was given fabulous service at the bar. Our formal dinner server, was just ok. The reataurant was VERY busy so I can understand on occasion things may slip however, the whole meal was barely average. Shrimp cocktail was good although one shrimp was not deveined. Gross. And the $18 soup was removed from our bill when we asked whether it was supposed to be served cold. At that point, I honestly didn't know. The server made up a story about the new metal ladles used to pour table side and how the heat escaped at the top. I've worked in a couple of fine dining restaurants, your excuse was ridiculous. You should have freshly poured that right before it left the kitchen. I was convinced by the server to try the duck (probably because it was $10 more than the chicken I wanted) and when it arrived, it too wasn't hot, barely warm and was chewy. I didnt care for the rice bed it was on either. A true dissapointment. I didn't complain about that one, i just stopped eating it. I tried some of my husbands filet and that was actually really good! No one ever asked me how I liked my meal, only my wine. I hated not tipping the guy better but seriously, he didn't deserve it. I could see how typically the service would be better. Just not the great experience others have had. Disappointing. Keith the bartender should however be recognized. He was awesome! And would be the only reason to return.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Here, I first learned of the Eiffel Tower Restaurant. It was hard to miss with one glowing remark after another...each poster mentioning how helpful Lyle, the supervisor, was in securing just the right window table for their special occassion. I never would have dreamed that the supervisor of an establishment would take the time to contact me, but each poster assured me that Lyle was part of what makes the Eiffel Tower so successful. So I contacted Lyle full expecting my email to be passed along to someone in reservations. Not so! Lyle responded personally and made all the arrangements for our first visit. Much to my surprise, on the evening of our reservations, we were personally welcomed by Lyle who escorted us to our lovely window table scattered with red rose petals. The service was old world and elegant....the food beyond words. I realized then that I had stumbled upon something very special. We have made numerous trips back to the Eiffel Tower since our first visit two years ago. We are never disappointed in the romantic atmosphere, the professional service, and the delicious food. It is always elegant but never pretentious.  Last evening we returned yet again to what has become our favorite spot in Vegas. We were welcomed by Lyle, who we now consider a friend we look forward to seeing. If you are searching for that very special place to celebrate one of your life's milestones while in Las Vegas, look no further. Lyle and his wonderful staff will insure that your special occasion will be an evening of romance and celebration.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The views were pretty fantastic but the food was quite a let down. Each course was warm and lacked the quality finishing touches you'd expect. It was a busy night but when you're paying top money then you expect perfection I guess.

After a very short wait at the front desk on the casino floor, we were escorted to the restaurant floor, past the open plan kitchen and handed over to the table manager. The ambience of the place hits you straight away. It's fantastic and emulates a classy Parisian establishment to a tee, with excellent views over LVB and the fountains of the Bellagio.We were advised of a ten minute wait for a table so we opted for drinks at the bar. Excellent cocktails mixed by a pleasantly charming bar tender.Our original table was away from the huge windows, so I approached the Maitre D' and enquired as to the availability of a window table. This meant a slightly longer wait but was well worth it, and in the end we waited no longer than originally advised, and this was just enough time to have pre-dinner drinks at the bar anyway, so it never really felt as though we were kept waiting. The view from the semi-circular table, placed up against the balcony-style frontage was stunning - the Bellagio fountains to our right, the Casino Paris hot air balloon to our left. Perfect. And the lighting inside is just right so as to make the most of the night time view outside. No irritating reflections off the glass.The food was amazing. Simply can't fault it in any way. The menu wouldn't be a huge challenge for any skilled chef, but the critical difference is it was just superbly prepared. Classic dishes done extremely well.The service matched the cuisine, with even the manager stopping by our table to check everything was in order, and all the staff were attentive and enthusiastic without being intrusive.We weren't rushed, and by the end of our meal the first few chairs were being stacked as the restaurant wound down for the night. Anywhere else this might seem a little rude, but it fitted perfectly with the Parisian theme.Cost isn't prohibitive, and when set against other dinner options on the strip, the Eiffel Tower competes very well.This was a last minute choice for us - so glad we made the right decision. A fantastic dining experience, great for our honeymoon.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Window tables for 2 are only reservable for the 5pm or 5:15 seatings. When we gave our name the hostess acknowledged our anniversary - which was a nice touch. At end of the meal they brought us a special little mousse cup with happy anniversary written in chocolate (on the house). The view was gourgeous as was expected (directly across from Bellagio fountains). Food was very good - I remember commenting when I ate it, but I do not give the restaurant an "excellent" rating because less than a week later I can't really remember what I ordered. And for that kind of money I should still be raving about the meal, I can rave about the service - and the atmosphere and for a one shot special occaision definitely worth it.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

You can see the chefs cooking and dressing up the plates. They like to surprise their guests with how proud they are of their kitchen and chefs, I was later told.My husband and I had lunch, and were celebrating my birthday. We ordered the lamb burger, and the seafood salad. Both were absolutely awesome. We shared each other's meals, and with the palate cleanser, the fluffy rolls they serve you, the very attentive service, the beautiful linens on the tables, the classy red Eiffel Tower plates waiting for you at your table, the fabulous views....it all added up to be a truly wonderful experience. We paid $18 for the lamb burger, and $26 for the seafood salad, which had a wonderful dressing, lobster, crab, shrimp, and various greens. I've never tasted anything like it! My diet pepsi was $6.00, and I had three refills (free)! We could see the Fountains at the Bellagio, and for the hour we were there, it was nice to see the dancing waters, people walking along the Strip, and the other hotels. It would be an awesome view at night. I would go back again, for a special occasion. I will never forget this restaurant!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

I contacted the manager of the restaurant, Lyle Tolhurst, a couple months ahead of time to request the primo "corner table" that directly overlooks the Bellagio fountains. He responded promptly and assured me they would do everything they could to impress us. Did they ever! He personally greeted us upon our arrival and offered us a complimentary photograph. We were then led to the corner table that I requested which was covered with rose pedals. Over the next couple hours, we were treated to a fantastic dining experience that included several complimentaries from Lyle. Overall, I would highly recommend this restaurant.

I was with five other guests who were all 1st timers and were going on my recommendation, so I hoped it was going to be just as good as my 1st visit. We had booked a table online before we jetted off and once we arrived everything was taken care of and our table was ready. Our waiter was amazing! He broke everything down into plain English and there was nothing he didn't know. The appetiser was a cauliflower cheese flavoured sauce in a shot glass which was divine. Then our starters arrived and I had the mushroom soup which was fresh mushrooms in an empty bowl and then came the waiter pouring over the soup flavourings !!! You have to try it. I never knew soup could be this good. My main was lamb which just fell of the bone and was so juicy you wouldn't believe!! Everyone had different mains and all enjoyed each one!! Now for the view... It's like a picture!! The location looking over the Bellagio and Cosmopolitan is breathtaking with full view of the fountains. If you go to Vegas, you HAVE to come here to try a meal and experience a setting you'll never get anywhere else.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

So delicious and beautifully presented. We also split a wonderful Grand Marnier Souffle that was placed on a plate decorated with "Happy Anniversary" in chocolate. Lovely. The waiter and staff were very attentive and the Supervisor of the restaurant visited our table personally and asked about our meal.

The view was great but we ate here the last night and by then, had seen the great view several days and nights in a row. Don't waste your money. There are so many great restaurants in Vegas.

We wanted the experience of dining in the "Eiffel Tower". I would recommend reviewing the menu before making a reservation. We were not expecting to spend over $125 per person. Disappointments: The elevator took us up to the restaurant. When the doors opened I didn't expect to see the kitchen. The interior design surrounding the kitchen space should be more inviting to the guests. When you walk around to the other side, the ambiance is very sophisticated. A glass of wine was approx. $20 and the serving size was much less then half of the glass, the beans almondine were tasteless, and the vegetarian crepe was not worth $32. I was very disappointed with the crepe. My mother and her boyfriend ordered the filet mignon. My mother's was very veiny and she was not happy but her boyfriend enjoyed his. The potato gratin was forgettable. The spinach and mushrooms were very good. I have no problem spending my money on a nice meal but this restaurant is over priced for the quality of the food. Overall: I'm glad we had the experience but probably would not go back. (The table next to us was complaining about the menu and cost.)</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Our Sunday October 7th. dinner was such an unexpected disappointment. We arrived at ETR right on time for our reservation but despite seeing our table was ready for diners, the woman at the podium greeting and checking in customers kept us waiting while she seated three parties who had arrived after we did; the woman’s brusk and indifferent attitude bordered on being just plain rude. My companion had the quail appetizer and Autumn Greens salad, both of which he enjoyed. His entre was the rabbit which consisted of a loin, sausage and a mousse; he said the loin was okay but not special, the mousse kind of strange and the sausage terribly dry (to which the waiter said it looked very dry) and he did not eat much of it. I had the foie gras which was quite good and the surf and turf; the filet was pretty good but the lobster included a large amount of rather odd mousse which was not at all appetizing. Our chocolate desserts were super good and we were not charged for those, I suppose because I had ordered a fairly expensive wine.The wait staff did a truly attentive and efficient job. The restaurant can be very noisy and that perhaps lessens enjoyment of the ambiance and experience.Bottom line however is that for a dining tab of $$600 plus (before wine and tip) one would wish for more welcoming treatment from the podium lady and the quality of the entrees.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

I was looking for the theatre as per the review, private glass elevator, opening into the kitchen et etc, what we got was cattled into the elevator with about 15 others than herded through the kitchen and left with a very flustered hostess who didn't appear to have a grasp of what was happening, there was a huge queue at the desk and about 30 people milling around' it felt more like ihop than a fine dining establishment (it also took 15 mins to get a drink at the bar whilst we waited for a table)Thankfully however after we were seated it turned around, lovely table for two right at the front with a direct view of the Bellagios fountains ( though I did make the reservation 6 months previous and did request the table) food was excellent as was the service, faultless and they even bought my husband a small birthday cake with his coffee which was a lovely touch . Id recommend the Restaurant for the view alone, the quality of food and service is an added bonus ( once you get past the reception desk)</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Girl Weekend for Rod Stewart concert</title><review>What a great dinner and sunset view overlooking the Bellagio fountains - 4 of us BFF were in Las Vegas for the Rod Stewart concert and we went for a pre concert dinner. I had been there in December 2010 for mine and my husband's honeymoon. The food was excellent, the service was excellent, the view, spectacular! We started with cocktails, mine and one of my friends had the Autumn in Paris - a vodka and pear puree drink, yum, it was so good! I am a big time pear lover and this was delicious. My other two friends had the Cosmopolitan and the Pink Lady (I believe that's what it was called.) They both were very impressed! Prior to ordering, the Chef sent out a cauliflower soup shot - oh, my it was tasty! Three of us began with the Maine Lobster salad, roasted butternut squash, wilted kale and old cider vinaigrette appetizer, the other the Blue cheese soufflé pudding, walnut, pecan, petite salad. The lobster salad was excellent, lobster cooked perfectly. Though I didn't taste, the blue cheese soufflé pudding was to die for from what my friend said. One of my friends and I shared the Individual Eiffel Tower Beef Wellington - have seen it many times on Gordon Ramsay's Hell's Kitchen but had never had it before - the pastry surrounding the filet was flaky, and delicious, the filet perfectly cooked medium rare, just as we both liked. The other two had the charbroiled filet with béarnaise sauce - I was a little envious as I am a huge fan of béarnaise sauce. They both raved about how good they were - both cooked medium rare perfectly. The beef wellington was plenty for two especially since we also shared the Galette of Potato Anna side. The potato anna is sliced potatoes layered and roasted with duck fat. We skipped dessert as we were on a time schedule which we had informed our server before hand and without feeling rushed in the least were out by 6:30 - reservation at 5:00 - we were seated within 5 minutes. Not to mention the fact we were all very full! We have decided to make this an annual trip and no doubt, next year, we will be visiting the Eiffel Tower again! Superb dinner and well worth the cost excursion.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

As the elevator doors opened we were presented with their immaculate kitchen. The hostess took us to our table overlooking the strip and the Bellagio fountains, what a view! I decided on the Alaskan King Crab with marinated melon balls and my wife had the Maine Lobster Salad, both arrived in a short time and were delicious. Our server was professional and had a great sense of humor. For our entrees, I had the Filet with lemon parsley butter and a side of Green Beans Almondine. She had the individual Beef Wellington. Again, the best fillet I have ever had and the Wellington was incredible. About this time the supervisor, Lyle, stopped by to say hi and ask if everything was ok. He handed us a business card and told us if we ever needed anything to contact him. Time for dessert. We both decided on the Creme Brulee. They arrived along with a complimentary selection of house sorbets that were incredible! My wife and I will definately visit every time we are in Vegas! Great customer service, great food!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We arrived early so we could see sunset. They greeted us with a "Happy Anniversary" and were told that they had a very nice table available right now if we wanted to sit right away. They brought us to the very best table in the house-the one seen on their ad on their website! It was amazing-to see everything as the sun was setting and watch all of the lights come on. We ordered from their drink specials menu and we had the surf and turf ($74!!) and Beef Wellington ($59) and the mushroom spaetzle ($10). We pre-ordered the chocolate souffle for dessert. You don't get a salad unless you order one, but they do come around with a big basket of 4 different types of bread to chose from. They do not rush you-which is so nice, so that you get to see the fountain show at the Bellagio. Our dinners were wonderful! And we were so full by the time our souffle showed up-but we managed to eat it!!! They also brought out a beautiful plate with a small cup of chocolate mousse with a sliver of choclate (with a picture of the Eiffel tower on it !). They had written "Happy Anniversary in chocolate around the plate. We did not have the photographer take our picture-instead we asked the folks at the table next to us to take our picture and we did the same for them. It was the most expensive dinner we had ever had ($250 with tip) but we don't regret it at all. It is truly the most romantic dinner we have ever had.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Would absolutely recommend trying to get a table for two. That way you are more likely to get a table around the perimeter so you can look out the window. We sat looking out over the Bellagio Fountains and watched their show every half hour. We ordered the pre fixe menu which was well worth it - it went on forever and was absolutely incredible. Maybe too much actually. I had a hard time eating the dessert. Although this was expensive, I felt worth it as it really showcases the chefs talents. Drinks, on the other hand, were way too expensive I thought. We also indulged in having our picture taken and the photographer was nice enough to email it to me as well, which out surcharging me - which was nice since that was what I really wanted anyway.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Instead, see if you can have a drink at the bar. At the end of the bar toward the fountains there is a high countertop with some high seats. Have a drink and watch the fountains, but be aware you can't hear a think, no booms, no music, no ahhhs...only the chatter in the restaurant. Three drinks, 2 house gins and a glass of wine ran $55, so even drinks aren't inexpensive.That said, this is a posh restaurant with a terrific view and you are paying for that as well.The wine list is extensive and varied, but in my mind very expensive. Prices start at about $70 with most in the lower range being in the low one hundred dollar range. This cost seems excessive to me, but they fill the room and get it.Our group of 3 started with mushroom soup which was enjoyed thoroughly and I had pork belly which was a small serving but very tasty - I can't opine further as this is the first time I tried it. The rack of lamb was nicely prepared although my companion felt it was a little on the rare side, that said, there wasn't a morsel on his plate when done. The fish fillet was typical and my guest wasn't overwhelmed. I had the farm raised chicken which was one of the lower cost entres on the menu and very good. Again, the serving size wasn't large, but it was adequate. We had two sides and they were night and day. One was potatoes gratin and the table enjoyed them - not my cup of tea due to the heavy cream and dense cheese. The asparagus was forgettable. In the day and age when most places serve vegetables al dente, these brought me back to the days of my grandmother cooking them until they were dead. There was no life in them and we should have said something, but didn't. I would return if on the Company dime again due to the view up and down the strip - we were seated far from being able to see the fountains, but I would not return if I had to pay out of my own pocket.</review><polarity>0</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

I emailed the restaurant supervisor, Lyle Tolhurst, to request a great table with a view of the Bellagio fountains. Lyle took my request a step further and suggested that we come a little earlier than planned to also catch the great sunset over the strip. The entire staff was very friendly and accommodating. Our server, Michelle, was professional and knowledgable. We were impressed that she congratulated us on our anniversary when she first arrived at the table, and she never made us feel rushed. The food was fabulous and the atmosphere can not be matched. Pricey? Yes. Worth it? Absolutely worth every penny.

We had a spectacular view of the strip and the Bellagio Fountains. The service was excellent. We all really enjoyed our meal. I had the lamb chop that was fabulous. We ordered the chocolate suoffle for dessert and it was amazing. It is very pricey but was worth it. We had our photo taken during dinner by restaurant photographer and it seemed to be the best photo from the whole trip. This is a perfect place to celebrate something special or just treat yourself to something unforgetable.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

I contacted the ETR, told them I was planning on proposing to my girlfriend and requested a window table for 7:00 overlooking the Bellagio fountains, even though they do not guarantee these tables beyond 5:30. We arrived on time and I was overjoyed to find, in my opinion, the best table in the house waiting for us. We had a complete and direct view of the Bellagio fountains. From the moment we arrived until we left, the entire experience was nothing short of first class and memorable. The food was truly fabulous, the service staff friendly, attentive, yet not obtrusive. And the ambiance was fantastic. My finance was duly impressed. After watching the fountains and slowly savouring our appetizers and some delicious wine, I got down on one knee and asked my girlfried to marry me shortly after the next show of the Bellagio fountains began. Of course, she said yes. Suffice to say, she was truly impressed. Throughout our meal, we were never rushed and left to enjoy the evening. Yes, the prices are not cheap, but they are not overly expensive and well worth it. Let's just say you can spend a heck of a lot more in Vegas for a lot less. For me it was great value. Overall, it was a truly memorable experience in a first class establishment, and I am very thankful to the ETR for making it memorable.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

This was an excellent choice.You are greeted at the ground floor of the Paris, and then take the elevator to the 11th floor where you pass by a view of the chefs in the kitchen as you go to the reception desk. We had arrived early for our dinner reservation, so we waited at the bar - and it was a very pleasant wait! It's a beautiful bar with a view of the Strip. The bartender was pleasant and quick to get our drinks. I would recommend a French Martini to get you in the mood for the dinner! Expect your drinks to be in the $15-$20 range.Our table was ready right on time, and we were brought to the table I had requested - right at the window with a perfect view of the Bellagio fountains. It was a small, half-round table, but plenty of room for the two of us, and very romantic!For the appetizer, we both ordered the roasted Foie Gras, which was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. We savored every bite! For the main course I had the Lamp, and my wife had the Filet Bearnaise. Both were absolutely delicious and cooked perfectly, but if there was a contest between entrees, the Lamb would have won. For a side dish, we had the Potato Gratin - an excellent choice.This amount of food turned out to be perfect for us. If we ordered anything more, it would have been far too much food. As it was, we really didn't have room to try the deserts. If you want the desert, I would suggest to skip the side dishes. The total for the dining room came to $224.00, including a martini and champagne - not bad at all for such an amazing meal.Everything about this dinner was perfect, and we'll definitely be going back to the Eiffel Tower again!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

You just turn your head to the window - it is all there, and you have the best seat.The food is also incredibly good. The way they cook salmon is remarkable, as are the salads and pate.

Beautiful Atmosphere! Wonderful Service!</title><review>I thought the Eiffel Tower Restaurant was an amazing way to start off our girls trip to Vegas! The service was excellent, we were seated immediately. Because we were a party of four, we could not get seated "against" the window, but was still able to see the Bellagio Fountains. We had reservations at 6pm and it was PERFECT because we got to see the sunset and the Strip "light up"! I had the Beef Wellington and it melted in my mouth! DELISH! It was cooked medium and spiced just right! The sides came with snap peas, which were drowned in butter and oversalted. My other friend was a Vegan and they accommodated her request and gave her an excellent meal (by far, the best out of all the restaurants we visited). One of the girls in the party was celebrating a birthday, so they brought her a yummy espresso mousse in a shot glass. We did not feel rushed, we enjoyed the ambience and the "old school vegas" vibe with the large booths and lush decor. It's definitely expensive, but they post the menu and price on their website, so you can choose your items and set your budget in advance and not be hit with price shock. It's Vegas after all! Go big or don't go at all!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

I must say the rack of lamb was outstanding, so if the service and communication improves, I would give a higher rating. And the views; you really can't beat.

We got all dressed up and arrived a little early but sat at the bar and chatted with Keith, besides the desk clerks and bus boys he was the friendliest employee. We had a spectacular view of the fountain across the way nd unfortunately I was glad to be witness it but had wished I wasn't paying $200.00 for the show. I have a rare mushroom allergy and the waiter had no clue what I could or could not eat. He told me to pick something and he would double check. Point lose number 1. We both ordered steaks and expected for $60.00 you would at least get a side salad but this is un true. So we wait and enjoy our view and we spoke more to young man serving bread and water then our waiter, our food arrives and its two hunks of beef. That's all, a sprig of parsley for plate design nothing 60 bucks worth. Mine had butter and lemon on it, my 3 year old can mix that up. Point lose 2and3. We cut into our dinner and filet minions are supposed to melt, cut with a spoon kinda deal, not so much. I needed effort into my steak knife to cut it. And my husband's steak, well he lost half his to a huge tendon and fat strip down the middle. Point lose 4and5. We again were on our honeymoon and we were surprised with a chocolate mousse dessert that was pretty good And the pistachios souffle was my favorite part but it did arrive very shortly after our dinners were gone, almost completely saying ok get gone. Point lose 6. I have told everyone avoid this establishment and grab a drink at the bar and go to a buffet. It was devastating.</review><polarity>-1</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

I made a reservation 3 weeks in advance of our trip and asked at that time for a window seat. Called again 3 days ahead of our arrival to make sure we had a window seat with a view of the fountains. Then came in that night, checked in, and once again asked for a good window seat....we got stuck in the far corner of the restaurant and could barely see the Bellagio fountains.We ordered a filet mignon (well) and a flat iron steak (med well). The waiter suggested that they cook the flat iron medium because medium well would make it too tough. I told him as long as it is pink and not bloody I will try the medium. He assured me it would be cooked to order.The steaks came out...the filet mignon was as tough as rubber and dry. The flat iron steak was pink on the edges and basically raw on the middle. It was still "mooing". Very disappointing.I have also been to plenty of Texas Roadhouse restaurants and they can cook the juiciest well done filet mignon, so I had thought a high end restaurant like this could figure that out...but I guess not. The sides were mediocre at best...potato croquetts, green beans, and au gratin. They were also $10 bucks a pop.You are clearly paying for the ambiance and view (which we didn't have anyway).Save your money and go to one of the buffets for better food.If we had to do it over again and save $250, we would NOT go here.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The only thing that was good about the steak was it was cooked to the med rare we both requested. I have had many filet migon that you could cut with a fork for half the price. How ever this one you need a chain saw to get through it. I also could have picked out a strip steak at my local chain grocery store that you could clearly see no fat in it. The strip steak was aged however and I asked my server how long the steak was aged for. His answer " I'm not sure no one has ever ask that. I can ask. They get delivered every morning though.". My server never returned with a answer so I still order it as my personal experience with aged strips have been flawless. However that was a mistake because of the giant piece of fat and tendon running through the middle. My wife and I did eat are steaks though and didn't complain of the poor quality of meat due to it being almost 9:00pm and we were looking forward to the pistachio souffle we order after are steaks arrived. Again a disappointment as pistachios have a strong precess of flavor in my opinion and this particular souffle does not. I have worked in the restaurant business for all my life and left a adequate tip for the service provided. How ever he might have been a rookie as we hardly seen him. On a good note Keith the bartender was very pleasant and made a drink for my wife that she enjoyed as she rarely drinks. He was very talkative and attentive to everyone's needs at the bar. I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone and tell them to buy what they want and I will cook it better for them for about a tenth of the price.

I fully expected this to be a "touristy" type of a dining experience and was pleasantly surprised to the contrary. The chef sent out a pea puree palate cleanser with cracked pepper cheese puffs that were delicious. We ordered the cucumber lemonade which was so refreshing and light after walking all around Las Vegas. I ordered the crepes with artichoke hearts and roasted tomato puree, wonderful. My husband had the lamb burger with homemade chips that was huge, succulent, and the best he has ever had. We had no room for desert but the chef sent out small bites of jellied and chocolate candies that we thoroughly enjoyed. The service here is also beyond reproach. This is a "must do" in Las Vegas.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We made a reservation for 6:30 as we had a show to go to later on that evening. We got there a little early 6:00 and asked if they could accommodate and they did, no problem. We got a window seat with a great view of the Bellagio fountain. Service was amazing from the get go. My dinning companion has a gluten allergy, and they had a gluten free menu which she was happy as it can get very limited at times. I ordered the roasted foie gras as an appetizer that was to die for. Melt in your mouth. For the main course, the pork chop. Although the taste and preparation was really good, it was a tad too salty for me. For the sides we had the green beans almondine and the potatoes gratin. I have to admit I am not a big fan of green beans but I could not stop eating them, they were so delicious. For the dessert I had a hard time deciding on which of the 6 soufflé flavor to choose, but went with the classic chocolate. It did not disappoint. Overall the meal was a great success. I wish I could give it a 4.5 but it won't let me. I wanted to give it a 5 but the pork was a little too salty for my taste. I would definitely go back.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We were seated quickly and had a relatively good view of the Bellagio water show. The appetizer menu did not contain anything that any of the four of us desired, but, being a french restaurant, that was expected. Two of us had the beef wellington, one had a filet mignon and the other a steak. We shared a side dish of green beans. Three of us had a glass of wine. Everything as a la carte, which came as no surprise. The entrees were a bit above average, not anywhere near delicious. We each had a coffee, no dessert. The bill came to $388 and with the tip close to $500.00. The service was very good. The food, ok.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

When I made the reservation (always recommended ) a week ago, I was asked if we were celebrating something special - we would be celebrating our 28th anniversary. On our arrival at the base of the elevator, we were escorted upstairs to the reservation desk, where we were congratulated on our anniversary and shown to our table. Our table for two was at the front window, facing the Bellagio so we had an excellent view of the fountain show during our meal. First, let me say, the service was impeccable. Our waiter was friendly and courteous and each course simply flowed into the next, without the feeling of being rushed. We started with a taster serving of Gazpacho that was so good, I'm now inspired to try making it myself again. Then Caesar salad followed my melt in your mouth Dover Sole for me (the best I've ever tasted) and the roasted Rack of Lamb for my husband, which he says was delicious and very tender. We didn't try desert although they looked wonderful. I would definitely return to this restaurant and highly recommend it.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We were shown right in and had a table overlooking the Dancing Waters fountain of Bellagio and The Strip. It was fantastic!The decor of the restaurant was very elegant- black and red velour. We ordered and shared an appetizer of escargots and sweetbreads that was very good.My husband got the Beef Wellington and I got the Braised beef shortribs. Both entrees were delicious, and we were too full to even think about dessert.We have eatedn at the Restaurant Jules Verne on the Eiffel Tower in Paris, and this was just as nice an experience.

They gave us a window table which was great. We had eaten a lot (it’s Vegas, right?) the previous day and since I tend to find French food to be the most overrated cuisine in the world (it relies on a reputation that died more than ½ a century ago-Southeast Asian cuisine-Thai, Vietnamese and Indian all blow it away but you still can’t overcharge for them at fine dining establishments) was not going to go all in and over order for items that I find bland (case in point-I was visiting a friend in Paris in 2004 and he took me to the alleged “place” to have cassoulet and it was bland and crappy as all can be and it was $20 at lunch a la carte). Well, the menu doesn’t make it clear but all the entrees are extremely a la carte (the “accompaniments” section is small and not inspired, buried at the bottom of the menu and easy to miss which we did). As in the main courses, while well prepared, are very petite. My seas bass was tender and nicely prepared but I almost couldn’t find the bed of quinoa it was sitting on. My wife’s Muscovy duck breast had the same approach. We had to scramble to order a side of potatoes as our entrees came out INCREDIBLY fast. In fact, so fast, that a major “faux pas” occurred. While our waiter was engaging and sharp, SOMEHOW, our entrees arrived before our bottle of wine did. I kid you not. I was shocked. I worked as a waiter eons ago to put myself through college at some pretty nice restaurants and this was something that just could not happen then or now. I just don’t know how this could happen at a top end place like this. I didn’t say anything since it was my wife’s birthday and didn’t want to make any sort of scene.They did redeem themselves nicely by bringing a gratis, personalized chocolate mousse for my wife which she loved. We had also ordered a chocolate soufflé in advance and that was prepared perfectly. In closing, this is a romantic spot and the view was great for Vegas (as I never want to return to cloudy, grimy and sad Gay Paris as my second wife has never been there so this served as a stand in for her) but I would rather pay top $ at, say, Nobu but I recently already did that their location in San Diego as this place tends to serve as a tourist event restaurant and not one of great culinary vision.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Loved it!</title><review>Definitely you need to go and experience the food, service and the view. Never been to Paris to compare but what an experience! Restaurant located in the Eiffel Tower which I thought was really cool. Booked reservations online, quick and easy. Requested the table location and our request was fulfilled. Decor is beautiful, black and red velour. Service was amazing so was the food. Atmosphere was very romantic. The view of Belaggio fountains just wows you. Highly recommend it for couples for any occasion or just a night on a town. Spent about $100 per person but you have to remember you are in Vegas so if you think that is expensive, think not! You will have to spend same amount of money just going to a regular restaurant, that's how expensive Vegas is. Overall the restaurant wasn't pricey compared to other restaurants on Vegas strip. The only thing I didn't like was that the entrance to the restaurant is thru Planet Hollywood (casino area) which stinks like beer/smoke/bar, just awful. I guess the casino area has poor ventilation. Also, please remember the restaurant closes at 10:45 pm. on a weekend but you can stay at the bar until midnight. Anyway, we loved it and it was worth it! Hopefully you'll enjoy it too.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Our reservation was set at 7pm with a request of a rose to be presented on the table at time of arrival. The interesting part of this review is that I actually had plans to ask my girlfriend out at this restaurant. We had been "dating" for months but never really made anything official you could say. Anyway, she was awe-struck at the rose pedals and rose placed on our awaiting table over-viewing the Bellagio water fountains. It was a sight I won't soon forget. The timing was also amazing since the sun was setting as the water fountains played across the distance. It was a perfect time to pop the question.The waiter caught on to how special of an evening this was, and was extremely attentive with a great personality. He was sure not to get in the way but also made sure our night was one to remember. He took pictures of us at the table, near the bar, and even near the kitchen. There was a professional photographer who also took our picture and had it presented in a red envelope after our meal.All of this already seems like a perfect night, but it gets better. The food was literary the best food I have ever had the pleasure of eating. My girlfriend had an amazing order of salmon while I enjoyed perhaps the best cut of rib eye ever. If you really want to enjoy the most excellent food and restaurant in Vegas, don't hesitate at making reservations at the Eiffel Tower.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

I had made prior reservations through open table and requested a window seat to view the Bellagio fountains. We were there around 8:15pm which was a wonderful time as the sun had just about set and the view was spectacular. We thankfully had our window request granted. Soooooo worth it. This is a very nice restaurant. Dress up. Men- if you don't have on proper attire the restaurant will even provide slacks and shoes. I witnessed that happen to a couple that obviously didn't understand what type of restaurant this was. Make a reservation or you will be waiting. We were promptly seated at our reservation time. I tried the escargot with sweet breads for an appetizer and my fiance had the fois gras. Both were very good! If you've been curious about trying escargot this is a safe version. Very nice sauce. If I didn't know what I was eating you wouldn't be able to tell :-)For dinner I had the lamb and and my fiance had one of the steaks (forgive me, I don't remember which cut). Both were excellent. We had the grand marnier souffle for dessert. Again, awesome. You have to order the souffle ahead of time which the rest of your meal though because it takes a while to prepare. I think maybe I should have had the creme brulee instead because I have a major sweet tooth and the souffle didn't quite give me my fix haha, but it was great none the less. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for special occasions/splurges. It is a bit pricey. I would not recommend it as a family restaurant as there are too many couples trying to enjoy themselves. Hope that helps!Thanks Eiffel tower~ we will be back!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We have been to Las Vegas numerous times, and enjoy dining at the top dining rooms there as well as in some of the finest of the world. For this occasion, I even bought a new dinner jacket, coming from Hawaii to dine high above the maddening crowds, overlooking the Bellagio Fountains and Las Vegas Boulevard. Leaving Las Vegas three days later, I am trying to recall the memorable evening's pluses and minuses as they come to mind.We were seated in a strategic table which did overlook the Fountains, and were greeted by our waiter, a young chap who made sure we remembered his name loudly. Very attentive, he was mostly business and suffered us little for our lighthearted attempts at humor...or was that being the French - mode' Parisian waiter inside him? He immediately agreed with our wine selection of a Chardonnay St. Michel, from WA state, at $82. It was good. However the next day I heard it was selling for $11 at Trader Joe's. Not good. But I digress, as I am not a connoisseur of fine wines. Our party ordered from a wide variety of offerings, tomato-basil-mozzarella salad, blue cheese souffle pudding, roasted foie gras for starters. It was amusing to note that our server Joshua took the "French" liberty of dousing the salads with "Tomato Water" poured most liberally from a dressing pitcher, a clear liquid which we rejoiced in, as if it were a holy anointment of sorts. Reminiscent of "The Emperor's New Clothes"-this was the crowning invisible, yet praiseworthy touch! C'est formidable! We will talk about it forever, even though we were probably victims of yet another Paris-inspired dining myth. It took me a while to peruse the menu for the fifth time before ordering the whole boneless Dover Sole, laden with capers; it was in the end, a tad too salty with the Grenobloise overload and ala carte prix of $69 the most expensive "meat" dish by far... The Racks of Lamb were uneventfully acceptable to good, and orders of both highly recommended Beef Wellington dishes did not disappoint -- at least in volume; somehow they count as overrated when my wife said she "shoulda ordered something more exciting and tasty" comparatively speaking. Melt in your mouth Wellington? Not quite. When in France, think: should you really order a beef dish with an English title? Or a fish from Dover, England?Copious sides of French beans, creamed spinach and potato gratin took the lesser roles nicely at $10 each, while everyone kept repeating, "That tomato water sure hit the spot!" Thus at the end, we shared three different flavored dessert Souffles, which were on the tiny side, sweet and tasty but with wet, smooshy endings--so Francaise!. Joshua put a sweeter finish to the dinner's end with a tray of fineFrench? chocolates which we had to pack for take out. All said, the dinner was a success, the Bellagio fountains playing in the background and mostly having good family and friends to enjoy it all. So what if Joshua did not enjoy the witticisms and corn-fed jokes of his guests? Is he really French? C'est la Vie! The next time, we will try lunch there, and the chicken looks good. I don't know when I will use my new jacket again, however!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Asked for a table by the window, which we got. Fantastic views of the Strip and the Bellagio fountains.The food is quite pricey and while the starters were nothing out of the ordinary, the mains (the steak and the chicken) were absolutely magnificent.So far so good. What doesn't quite add up in this place is the service. First, the two hosts were just miserable. The "Eiffel Tower Restaurant" is a place you take your girlfriend or wife for a special occasion but you are greeted by two girls who quite clearly wouldn't look out of place at your average highway diner. What is more, they offered no smiles, not even the shallow "How are you?" that is so ubiquitous in the U.S.Then, our waiter. Again, if you go to a fine restaurant, you'd expect your waiter to be knowledgeable, discreet and polite. Our waiter was none of these things. He had no idea about the wine - he offered me rosé champagne when I asked for a recommendation of a rosé wine to accompany our dinner. When a restaurant boasts a 40+ page wine menu (with the more reasonable wines costing $80 and upwards), you'd think they have a sommelier or someone who could at least tell the difference between sparkling wine and wine. Not here.Lastly, the bathrooms. They were filthy. There was a bathroom attendant but I always wonder why I should give them a dollar or two for handing me paper tissues when I would happily give them double that tip if the facilities were clean.All in all, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant. Yes, the food is great and so are the views but if you pay $300+ for a meal for two with wine, you should expect more class from the service. I don't know whether I just picked a bad night but in this price range, you can find much better in Vegas.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Rez are necessary, even on a Sunday night they are busy. There is a dress code (collared shirts, long pants for men - don't remeber for women) which was not too difficult to abide by for a Vegas tourist. The restaurant is not on the top of the tower; it is a few stories above the strip for a perfect viewing of the Bellagio fountains. They have a bar/lounge area, all dining tables have a view, and a full viewing area of the kitchen if you are so inclined. We arrived 30 minutes early and had specialty cocktails at the bar. The Service:Each staff member was 100% on with their customer service skills, from the elevator greeters (title?) to the managment. The table bussers were amazingly fast and efficient - like none I have experienced before - just waiting to pounce on any perceived need. Our table was ready on time, and prepared correctly with the roses my husband had ordered. Our table captain (Joshua) knew the food and menu intimately, and could explain any dish in detail. Clearly he had worked there for a long time, which I feel is a good sign in the restaurant industry. We also rated a visit from the manger, Mr. Mackani, who checked in on us after our meal - before dessert. Again, I feel this is a good sign, and it also served to make us feel like special guests (I did not observe him doing this for other diners, so maybe we were trouble-makers?)The Food:All of the courses arrived with perfect timing. We were asked at the beginning of dinner service if we had time constraints (ie, show reservations), which we did not. We ordered our dessert (the soufle) at this time as well. While all the food is 'a la carte and individual portions' on the menu, (we were told this by Joshua as well), do not be fooled into thinking you should order a lot of extras to fill up. Portion sizes are just fine if you are normal eater. They serve bread of which you can have as much as you want - 4 or 5 varieties, an amuse bouche pre-app, and petits fours post dessert. We were also served a special anniversary chocolate mousse-cream bite. We did not order wine - I cannot drink it - however according to my husband the wine list looked fine. Here is my one 'if I could do it over' comment: we would have ordered less food, so we could have room for another dessert at the end. Apps: Blue cheeze soufle (will order this everytime - awesome)  Quail (sauce was very good, bird cooked well, nice app - but - with the main course meat, I will probably not order it again as it was too filling)Main courses:  Beef Wellington - cooked med rare perfectly, complex sauce, just right pastry, and even the snap peas were just right texture. Rack of Lamb: Outstanding, cooked to perfection medium rare, could cut it with a fork. Sides: Mushroom Spaetzle - good mushroom flavor - but would drop this item as well to prevent over-filling. Creamed Spinach Mushroom - Very good side for both dishes. Dessert: Caramel Soufle - Heavenly. I wish we had room for and ordered a second soufle (there are several varieties).Cost summary: We were not on a budget. We had a total of 3 specialty cocktails, as well as bottled water as opposed to tap water. Along with the above listed food items, our bill (not including roses or tip) was just under $270. While this seems pricey at first glance, by Vegas standards for a high-end meal, this is a good value. And, I would venture to say that two people could eat here very comfortably for a $200 tab, and not feel like they missed out.I would definitely eat here again for a special occasion.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We booked a window seat early. It was quite busy. The window tables where very small, half tables really. We saw the fountains go at least 3 times during our meal. We ordered the prefixed dinner and my husband added the wine pairing. The chef added at least 2 extra courses. The soup was the best part of dinner. Both my husband and I had been sick the last week, so half way though our courses both of us where turning green literally and on top of that we where really getting full. It seemed like the plates just kept coming and coming. I ended up drinking almost all the wine pairings. We where so full and not feeling well that we boxed our dessert and main courses. One course, the halibut, was aweful. I love fish and couscous but this preparation was terrible, it was very fishy and the couscous was runny and tasted spoiled. The restaurant manager came over personally and deducted that part from our bill. Also, I didn't much care for the lobster salad. The lobster was cold and rubbery. Out of all the 4 diamond restraunts we visited on this trip, this one had their wine pairing spot on. Who ever the Sommelier is, they deserve a raise, outstanding. The meal was higher then the other places we went with the final bill over $300 for two people. Although we where full, when we mentioned in conversation that our trip was to celebrate our anniversary we recieved another dessert (mango sobet) to share, which they did not have to do. By the end of our meal it became almost commical at how many plates of food we had. Both my husband and I joked about it the rest of the night. In the end, most of the food was average other then the soup, the wine pairing where excellent, the view wonderful, and staff very on top of everything. Not likely we would ever go back, for us it was a once in a life time dinner.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We went for lunch though, so it wasn't too busy. We were seated by the window and were promptly served some sort of puffed rolls, with cheese and herbs infused. They were delicious!We ordered the onion soup to start and I ordered parmesan chicken and my husband ordered a lamb burger. Our food came and was delicious. The soup was probably my favorite part. We were feeling very full by the end and so declined dessert, but were still given some jellies and chocolate truffle and then were served a small chocolate mousse, on a decorated plate that said Happy Anniversary, which was a total surprise (they had asked when I booked if it was a special occasion, but had said nothing while we were there).

The service was prompt...we were seated right away, there was always someone available when needed, our waitress was sure to ask us if we wanted the chocolate souffle (sp?) before our meal was served because she knew it would take a 1/2 hour to prepare and didn't want us to have to wait too long since we had the Celine Dion concert right after. Our dinner was fantastic.. I didn't know I could enjoy a pork chop as much as I did. The potatoes gratin (sp?) had little to no flavor so I do not recommend that side dish, but everything else was very good. A little expensive, but I guess when you figure in the entertainment from the Bellagio Fountains, it's worth the added expense.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We were seated promptly at 8pm, per our reservation, but that's where the promptness stopped. It was 15 minutes later when we got the drink and wine menu. I told our server that we'd make a wine selection after we made our meal choice so we could pair the two accordingly. I did this in hopes he'd bring a food menu.It was 8:30 before we received our food menu and 9:00 before we received bread. Finally, at 9:30 - a full 1.5 hours after sitting down, we had our meals in front of us. The food was delicious but I can't say it was worth the 1.5 hour wait - especially not when we're spending $200+ on the meal.I asked one of our table attendants if this was a common occurrence or an unusual situation and he said it sounded unusual and he'd look into it. We never saw him again. Overall, I was pretty disappointed in my experience.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

I mean trying to recreate the ambiance and quality of dining in Paris is no mean feat, especially in Vegas but I am pleased to say that I wasn't just impressed I was wow'd! Once inside this restaurant you could be in any Michelin star restaurant in the world! The layout, ambiance, lighting, atmosphere and service was impeccable and faultless. We were directed to the bar until our window seat table was ready, the barman was skilled and well trained and could see that we were overcome by the 400 page wine list, so asked what we liked and offered us a specially made drink to compliment our tastes and preferences. Our table was intimate and by the glass window over looking the Belagio fountain which was superb, although you can't fully appreciate the atmosphere as you can't hear the music but the views are equisite. The menu was varied and extensive and out of all the places we have eaten around the world, to this day nothing has replicated the steak that we experienced here! It was moist, tender, succulent and tasted divine! I don't eat desserts generally but I couldn't resist trying a french culinary classic to test the kitchens true abilities And ordered a pistachio souffle, I was not disappointed it was probably one of the best that I have ever eaten! I cannot tell you how impressed I was, I only wish we could have done the chefs tasting menu, which I can only imagine to be fabulous! Some people have commented that the service was not great, but our servers/waiters were attentive and informative and we wanted for nothing! Overall an unexpected wonderful dining experience!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Amazing!I had booked it for 8pm so by the time dessert came the sun had set and the fountains where all lit up, def a must if you go.The dinner was awesome, so tasty, I had the Steak which was one of the best steaks I have ever had and was cooked to perfection, my wife had the beef rib with Noodles and this was also delicios, great combination of flavours. Dessert is a must, I had the chocolate tasting platter and my wife had a banana and white chcolate tower thing, both where amazing to look at as well as eat!Service was perfect, you dont want for anything, treated perfectly.Overall a great experience, One warning is it is expensive, we where $200+ for our diner but dont let that put you off, it is worth it after all the only other place you can dine like this is in the actuall Eiffel Tower in Paris!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Unfortunately on the night we were there in July, the service did not meet our expectations. We had requested a table at the window, which we did get, however we felt hurried throughout our whole meal experience. I had not actually finished my amuse bouche when the waiter arrived with our starter and proceeded to move plates around for space. At various times during the meal we were startled as a waiter appeared unexpectedly between us (the tables for two face the window) and poured more drinks (a simple' excuse me' would have been appreciated!). Either during the Starter or the Main the waiter asked if we would like to order dessert, and that if we did and wanted the souffle, we had to tell him now, as it took 30 mins to cook. For what we were paying, I would expect to be able to remain seated long enough after my main dish to await this dessert's preparation! To cap it all, we were still eating our main dish when the bill was placed on our table. I have to say the food was lovely, but as the title says, the service did not match. We had looked forward to a really lovely experience, but felt rushed the whole time. It was only a Monday night too.From other reviews it does appear that we were unlucky with the service that night, however we will not be back.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

How could this not be better? Let me count the ways. Our server had very little knowledge of the menu, the food was just ok, and the service was slow. The view of the fountains of the Bellagio helped take some of the focus away from the service but not entirely. One expects excellent service in a place like this. I actually waited several days to write this so I could cool my proverbial jets. We made a reservation many months ahead and the staff was short and rude. We should have known then this wasn't the same caliber we were expecting. We were shortly in to our dinner and the photographer showed up and offered to take our picture. We thought this was a great option and chose the fountain view picture. She said she would return one of the times the fountain was going. She never came back to our table. She took the pictures of the table next to us and we figured she would be back but she wasn't. We saw her chatting in the kitchen as we left. We sat and waited quite some time for our check so she had plenty of time. We were there almost 2 hours with all our courses. Speaking of courses... if anyone at the table orders the tasting menu, everyone has to. Most restaurants are able to plate other food around the tasting menu. This one can't/won't. We have both worked in restaurants that do this on a routine basis, and this was certainly not a busy night there as less than half the tables were filled. They did have an amazing mousse, but that is to be expected in a French restaurant like this. Probably won't be back, but looking forward to going to their downstairs neighbor asap.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

I enjoyed the duck as my entree, which was very good, though I wish the sides were a little bigger so I also ordered their green beans. They were delicious. I would have liked to order some wine, but they were very much out of my price range. I also tried the braised short ribs, which were very tender and the sauce was yummy!

When we were sat at our table, very good location, the table cloth had spilled salt and pepper on it. The charger plate was dusty?!?!?!?! How does this happen at a restaurant with this sort of reputation? When our waiter approached us we were asked us if we had plans to see a show after dinner, were we in a hurry? I assured him that we were not in a hurry and that we planned to take our time. The steaks we ordered were overcooked. We were hurried out and not even offered a desert menu or coffee?!?! I will not be going back to this restaurant and I will not be recommending it. If I want to eat a hurried steak I can go to Outback!</review><polarity>-1</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

He not only responded promptly but he secured probably the best table in the restaurant, right on the corner of the building, with a perfect view of the Fountains. The restaurant staff who served us all knew it was our Anniversary and we were made to feel very special. Lyle even organised for a special trio of desserts (like a sampler dish) with "Happy Anniversary" written in chocolate sauce around the edge of the plate to be delivered to our table at the end of the evening.It truly was a magical experience and a memory that we will cherish for years to come.I have no hesitation in recommending Eiffel Tower Restaurant as a 'must do' expreience when you are lucky enough to be in Las Vegas!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The views, service and fhe food are the best in the city. A bit pricey but nothing different than any big city or great restaurant. Ask for a window seat to watch the Bellagio's fountain shows. This was my second trip to Vegas and my second dinner at the Eiffel Tower. I know I will be back.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We were lucky enough to get a table at the window which offered fantastic views of the Bellagio fountains as well as the strip and the fireworks at midnight.The food was nice. We ate about 6 courses as part of the set menu which included a lobster mousse, fois gras, and oysters. I can't say I'm really into French cuisine however I did enjoy the food presented to us. The waiter was great and recommended a couple of great cocktails and a fantastic Armagnac. You do pay a lot for this all though. For myself and my partner, the bill came to $1100, which included the tip.Whilst it was a good experience, I definitely wouldn't go back on New Years Eve again, simply due to the massive bill. I think the restaurant at the Stratosphere would offer a better menu at a cheaper price with just-as-awesome views.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

I thought to myself how can we sort out the bill ourselves and pay our share! Finally, at the end the manager was called over and he did in fact instruct the waiter to arrange separate bills, which he should have done in the beginning. However, I must say the dinner experience there was impressive.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

As with all upper-class restaurants, pretty much the entire menu is À la carte. For a full meal for two plus two drinks we paid around $200, which is obviously pricy, but was worth it.Hostess took our coats, our table was ready and waiting for us, wait staff was attentive and very polite, asked if we were celebrating anything. I'd highly recommend the Eiffel Tower Restaurant for a romantic dinner out, as long as you have the bucks to shell out for the experience.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

They have a kids menu although I would not recommend this place for children unless they are the very quiet type. It is a French restaurant. Everything is expensive and the portions are small. All food was tremendously delicious! I had half avocado, and tomato salad (I don't eat much red meat). Both were exquisite. My husband had the open faced steak sandwich (it was served beautifully of course) and he loved it. My daughter had spaghetti :) http://www.eiffeltowerrestaurant.com/images/eiffel/pdfs/menus/lunch.pdfI had an Eiffel tower signature drink (18$) which I can't stop dreaming about.

Food was not good.</title><review>We went here for a nice dinner before seeing Cirque Du Soleil.pros:  They were very fast and professional, service was excellent views are fabulous side dishes were goodcons: The food was not good.I got the salmon and my boyfriend got the cod. His food came out and the um... "cod" tasted more like warm, unflavored gelatin. The only discernible flavor in the dish was the plastic-y taste of the bag used for poaching. "Not good" doesn't even begin to describe it. When we told the waitress, she said that everyone hates that dish but the chef refuses to remove it from the menu. I had ordered the salmon, and although it was slightly overcooked, it was very tasty. They offered to replace the nasty cod with the salmon. So we waited. and waited. and my food got cold. we ate the side dishes which were good. we ate bread, which was good. His salmon came out and after a few bites, we discovered that it was entirely raw in the center. We told the waitress and she said "oh, that's medium, medium-rare. That's how we cook it". I told her that I'd never had salmon prepared that way without an indication in the menu/description and pointed out that their cooking must be quite inconsistent since we both ordered the same thing and got completely different preparations. And she argued with me about it and said "Yeah, I'm sorry but that salmon isn't raw... I guess yours is just overcooked"whatever. I guess she felt badly about it... or realized that she'd just managed to significantly reduce her tip.... she came back and gave us a few candies and removed the salmon from the check. Totally didn't matter. We still paid a lot of money for a terrible, awkward, poorly timed, not-good dinner.</review><polarity>-1</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

The wait staff is exceptional, and the sommelier knew his stuff (including the smell of soil on the Rhone vineyards!) The lamb was perfectly pink, the duck cooked like I can never manage at home and everything came at the right time. It was very busy -- Saturday night -- but looking over the Bellagio fountains with a jaw-droppingly expensive martini (ginger-flavored) killed the time nicely. We were seated about 30 mins after we arrived but I think that's just a ruse to get you to buy something at the bar. Wine is pricey but well selected and the food is so delicious we bought the cookbook. All the mousses -- savory or sweet -- are perfect. And they brought us a special dish for our anniversary - a sort of card on a plate - written in chocolate with a chocolate mousse shot glass. We saw other people celebrating events and they were all recognized with a complimentary food item. When you make a reservation they ask if it's for a special event. Overall it's expensive but they give you amuses bouches throughout the meal and petites fours at the end. For a treat it can't be beat. (Take money to the Women's room - there's a lady handing out towels and it's customary to give her a buck or two. )</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

I can't deny the food was excellent, although I've had just as good for a fifth of the price. Nearly $300 when we only had 2 mains and shared a desert is just to much. Nice location but we where put deep in a corner. The guy expecting a tip in the toilet really isnt necessary, and expecting a tip for watching you take a pee is just rude. In summary like many things in Vegas now,this place is overpriced.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Las Vegas was the jumping off point for an eight day AAA Executive's National Park Adventure, so we had decided ahead of time to crash one last night in Las Vegas after our whirlwind adventure and we decided a fine dining experience was the best way to finish off our western trip. So, how to choose? Naturally a visit to the Trip Advisor website was in order. In a short time the reviews kept us coming back to the Eiffel Tower as the spot that best blends fine dining with the whole 'Vegas' experience.I am now pleased to report that our visit to the Eiffel Tower on June 27, 2012 not only met all our expectations, but I will safely say they exceeded them. We had made our 7pm reservations months before with Lyle the restaurant manager. Since we had made this deal via e-mail naturally we were worried that we would be kicked to the curb upon arrival as 'high-rollers' took all the good window seats. I am so pleased to report to all our fellow Trip Advisors that Lyle kept his part of the bargain by reserving for us not only a window table, but THE table featured in their ad--you know the corner table that overlooks the strip as well as the Bellagio fountains. We were blown away. I feel that this table assignment is a great reflection on the power of Trip Advisor. I do not believe one for a minute that we would have received the same treatment if we had just called the restaurant directly on our own.Now for the actual dining experience, I will simply say that the service, the food, and yes the prices charged were all in line with what the positive reviewers had foretold visitors what to expect. Therefore I shall not attempt to do a 'food' review because that is well covered by so many other reviews. But what I will say is this..we went by our hotel's casino on the way to the Eiffel Tower and saw that one of the slot machines featured single plays at $100 a pull. So the choice is yours..two or three pulls on a machine or a couple of hours of top shelp dining. Either way it satisfies what you will call a "Vegas" experience.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We arrived just before 11:30am and were seated in a corner window overlooking the strip and Bellagio. The service was prompt and friendly, the food was good, but not spectacular like I was expecting. But I'm still giving 5 stars for excellent service and a good experience.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

You can eat at other local places in Las Vegas and get just as good food, but they do have the best view. But the good thing is the price keeps certain people out (tacky dressed tourist and other poorly dressed people). We had a blast and will go back sometime. My wife and I had 2 glasses of wine each and dinner and with tip it was $250.00. Well worth it for the anniversary!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

It's pricey; definitely check out the menu on the Paris Hotel website before you go to make sure you're comfortable with the prices. (I'm calling it "a little pricey" -- appetizers in the mid-to-upper teens, entrees in the mid-30's to mid-40's -- but I'm sure it's in line with most of the higher-end restaurants in Las Vegas. For some people, this pricing is not a big deal; for others, it's much higher than a normal night out, so I'm just trying to provide information to help guide anyone considering dining here.) I won't go into detail on the food choices, as I think many of the previous reviews here do that pretty well. I'll just reiterate that it's very good, and if you're looking for a nice meal in Las Vegas, and willing to pay a bit of a premium for the view, then the Eiffel Tower Restaurant is a good choice.The view is as good as advertised. If possible, you want to get a table as near the front point of the restaurant as possible, as that will give you the best view of the Bellagio fountains. Our table was fairly far to the left side, and I could see about half the fountains without really craning my neck or standing up; if your table is closer to the center, you can take in the whole view of the fountains dead on. If you're not in a rush to dine, and they start to lead you to a table too far off-center, ask if you can wait for a front-and-center table opens up. (We were going to a show after dinner, so I decided not to risk a long delay asking for a different table.) Again, there are no BAD views; I'm just offering this as a tip if getting the best view is important to you.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Unforgettable Evening</title><review>I Went To the Eiffel Tower Restaurant on June 19, on my 2 year anniversary with my girlfriend.I had made a reservation a few months before and got in touch with the restaurant manager Mr. Lyle T. (who you can see reply to some reviews in here) and he was very helpful in setting up an amazing dinner experience for me and my girlfriend, we got a very lovely window table with an amazing view.My plan was to propose during dinner so i called in advance and made arrangements to have the ring delivered. The staff was very nice and helpful , i asked the waiter to take a video with my personal camera while the ring was delivered and i proposed. It was great.The food was amazing... never in my life have i had so much sensory overload on my tastebuds we were full to the max and we even left a little bit of our main dishes but we couldnt take anymore in..... and then they brought the souffle.... wow. Delicious, amazingly light , we were full but we still ate it all in a breeze. I had the chocolate and my now fiancee had banana.The whole experience while expensive was worth every penny, we got out of there happy, engaged, mesmerized by the view, and we have memories that will last the rest of our lives.I really want to thank the manager Lyle and everyone in the staff and our waiter (his name was 'Roman' or 'Roland' or something like that, i apologize for not remembering it to well but i was nervous by the proposal.Highly recommended restaurant, would gladly skip a show on next visit to dine here again.-Daniel</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The menu is truly pedestrian with no imagination whatsoever. Prices are targeted for lame high-rollers and we pity the poor punters that take their significant others there for a once-in-a-lifetime celebratory occasions.My wife and I joined her clients in from out of town with another couple for a birthday dinner. We opted for wine-by-the-glass, but the list was MBA/CPA optimized for maximum gouging. The menu was strangely limited, although each category - beef, fish and non-beef - about 6 selections each, was hardly stimulating. New York Strip, rib eye, rabbit, halibut. Yawn. Started off with a vichyssoise that tasted like it came from a can. The taste of the French bread was terrible! Local Vietnamese sandwich shops offer fresh French bread with better texture and taste. Then we waited - for an hour before the mains were served. The average entre price is $50. Salads are $12. With so many fabulous restaurants in greater Las Vegas, we're loath to return. All the view in the world didn't make the dinner experience any better.Semi-retired food snob. He doth protest too much.</review><polarity>-1</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

After making reservations and given that I had family from Brazil on their first visit, I requested a table next to the window overlooking the water show at the Bellagio. I was informed that I would have to request specific seating from the Maitre d' upon arrival. I arrive early and was advised by the lobby attendant for the restaurant that a tip would help. I tipped the Maitre d' $50...got nothing, except not by the window and half of our table's view blocked by an iron pole running through the restaurant.If you can't or won't accommodate, don't take the tip!!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We had expectations that it would be expensive and worth it. They surpassed expectations. We made reservations with open table a month in advance where we wrote in that it was our anniversary, and then forgot all about it. Imagine our surprise then when, WITHOUT TIPPING ANYONE, we we're given the most amazing table - directly in front of the Bellagio fountains. The waiter knew it was our anniversary (he gave us a little pre-dessert dessert treat with 'happy anniversary' on the plate) and so did the manager - who stopped by our table not once, but twice. The service here is exemplary. The food was wonderful. I had the heirloom tomato salad (OMG, amazing - I could have tipped the plate and drank the tomato water, but then again, I'm a veggie person) and the chicken (very good). My husband had the peeky-toe crab salad (good) and the lamb ("AMAZING!! The best lamb I have ever had"). We both had souffles for dessert - my husband had caramel (incredible - infact it was so good, that he, who is not a dessert person, only gave me one tiny bite). I had chocolate souffle (excellent). While we were having dessert, the manager came by and asked if we were enjoying it. We said yes, then he asked if either of us cooked. !!!!!! I DO !!!!!! He promptly pulled the recipe out of his pocket, gave it to me, and offered 3 suggestions for preparation.WOWand the view . . . I don't know how it could have gotten better. I can't imagine that even the Bellagio's rooms could have that view - they just don't have enough distance to see the whole thing.It was a very lovely evening, and my husband and I would like to say thank you to the wonderful staff who made the evening so wonderful and to the manager, Lyle Tolhurst, whose service extends above and beyond - in fact, the day after our meal, my husband recieved an email thanking us for coming.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We took the waiter's recommendation and ordered the baked bleu cheese appetizer (yum!). The bread was pleniful, fresh and a wide variety. The wine list was extensive and they offered several wines by the glass. I enjoyed a California Chardonnay. Our son and I ordered the Beef Wellington, which was flavorful and cooked to a perfect medium rare. It was served with fresh pea pods and pearl onions. The side of sauted mushrooms was a perfect pairing. My husband ordered the lamb and it was delicious, perfectly prepared and full of flavor. Our desserts were the highlight though. It was our son's 21st birthday celebration; they brought him a decadent chocolate mousse on a decorated plate--very nice. In addition, he ordered a choclate souffle--scrumptious! I had the cookie plate, it was an array of small sized chocolate cookies, cakes, and mousse. My husband enjoyed his creme brulee-- though average in his opinion. We were stuffed and happy, then our waiter came around with a tray of choclate and cookie samplers. A perfect way to top off the evening.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We made reservations several weeks in advance and upon arrival were shown to a table at the front of the restaurant next to the window overlooking the Bellagio fountains. Wow!Our waiter was extremely helpful and as my husband isn't a wine drinker we opted for a recommended bottle of champagne which was delicious ($70).We had read reviews about the portions being small so we opted for a Starter, followed by a Soup, Entree and we ordered the signature chocolate and caramel souffles in advance. The Blue Cheese souffle starter is to die for, although the raw marinated beef that my husband ordered was equally delicious. We had the salmon and rabbit for entrees and could highly recommend both. By this point we were so stuffed, but we had the souffles to come, they were very light and not too sweet and we're glad we ordered them as they finished off the perfect meal. I can only presume that the people who complained about small portions are more used to standard american restaurants where, to us Brits, the portion sizes are enormous. I can honestly say that we ordered 1 course too many and that 3 would have totally filled us up.We thought it was a lovely touch that the Manager came and introduced himself during our meal and congratulated us on our anniversary. I also received an email from him when I returned home to thank us for dining and welcoming us back in the future.All in all the 4 course meal + bottle of champagne + tax + decent tip (for a truly lovely waiter) it came to $450, but we had accounted for this and were prepared for paying this much. Anywhere else and I would have felt a little begruding at paying so much for a meal but my husband and I felt it was worth every penny......and we are lucky enough to be able to celebrate there again this year. I can hardly wait!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Since I have been to Italy ten years ago, after their authentic tasting pasta nothing was comparable, except this place. Out of all the Italian restaurants this tops off everything.

I always wanted to be on top of the Eiffel Tower to be proposed to so why not in Vegas? :)The restaurant is nice enough. The window seat has great views. The waitress was great.The entrees were OK to good. But not great. For the price, you expect great. I had the pea soup with carrot caviar. It was good. But just good.First of all, we were still eating our entrees when they came with our mains (only halfway through our entrees). The waitress apologised and offered to keep them warm. This worried me a tad because I'm pregnant and food has to be served hot, not warm.When we finally finished our entrees, our mains came through within seconds. As I'm pregnant, I was very specific about my lamb to be cooked completely (no pink) and towards the "well done". I made sure the waitress knew this and to let the chefs know. I had to take it back 3 times (it was definitely medium rare) and still wasn't good enough. I gave up the 4th time and gave it to my husband to eat. All they did was heat the plate - not actually re-cook the meat!After that, I just didn't feel like dessert. Apart from the lovely waitress (where 2 stars have been awarded plus 1 for view), the food was OK, chefs didn't listen to what was asked and the bill at $300 (with only 1 glass of wine for my partner and water for me) was exorbitant (as we only had 2 entrees and 2 mains).I recommend Le Cirque hands down over this place. Sorry Eiffel Tower.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

While the quality of the food is excellent, the prices are quite high-budget $200 for a two course dinner for 2 with coffee. Beware: a standard cup of coffee is an eye popping $6.50!!! and was fair at best. If the price were on the menu, we would never have ordered it. I am sure no one else would either...which is why the price is not on the menu.On the plus side, they served the finest filet mignon any of us has ever eaten (at the cost of $56 for a 9 ounce portion with a delicious red wine sauce) but no other accompaniments.Scallops were also excellent. When we were last here in 2011, we had the tasting menu which was a $99 per person gastromic feast. Unfortunately, everyone at the table has to agree to order this, and some of the selections this time were not to everyone's liking.As a special occasion treat, this place is worth a visit.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

I'd definitely recommend going here for lunch if you'd like the service of fine dining but don't want the $200 bill that comes with ordering supper here. We came at 11:30 when it opens but even an hour later there wasn't that many people in the restaurant. I suspect that everyone there for lunch had a window seat. Even though the fountains aren't running at lunch the view is still spectacular. The service was excellent, although my only small complaint is that our waiter was VERY pushy in trying to sell more. It got quite uncomfortable towards the end of the meal. For example we ordered one appetizer to share and he kept trying to sell us two, we ordered two drinks and he was trying to push a bottle of wine on us, after we finished his meal he asked us like 5 times if we were sure we didn't want a coffee or dessert. However everyone else in the restaurant who attends to you is the pinnacle of polite and professional! The food was excellent. I ordered the BLT and it was the way a BLT should taste. The bread was amazing and they didn't skimp at all on the avocado slices. My mom had the open faced steak sandwich and she really enjoyed it. We were served these little cheese puffs before the meal and I could have eaten them in place of my meal!! Sooo good! We ended up ordering the creme brulee to share. It's quite big as it comes in a bowl not a little ramekin so don't believe your waiter if he tries to sell you two. It was cooked perfectly, the way creme brulee should be!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

That's really a little too early but a later booking will not have you planted at the window (as requested.) Food and wine was probably 3 star and the view 4+ star. We were staying in the Paris and had a view of Bellagio fountains from our 25th floor room so having that same view for dinner was not a huge plus for us, but would be for others. I found the service to be a little overbearing. Even though we passed on ordering the souffle desert at the same time as our entree, a desert menu was provided again at the conclusion of our meal (not a big deal by itself but read on...). Frankly, thought it was a little pretentious (and insulting) when I was told how to eat my meal "to maximize the convergence of tastes and textures on the palate". Saw major efforts to upgrade wine/drink orders, entrees and deserts at tables surrounding us. Even heard a pitch for the Eiffel Tower ride that "could be added to their dinner bill". Seemed the wait staff had commissions riding on upgrades. Overall, the food was better than average, the view excellent (otherwise the setting is about average for an upscale restaurant), the cost on the high end and the overall experience about 3 stars. Wasn't disappointed but it did not blow me away either.</review><polarity>0</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

First let me say that my wife and I are not used going to restaurants with this type of atmosphere. I read lots of reviews on this site and one other prior to our trip to Las Vegas. I knew most reviews were wonderful. I read a couple of reviews that mentioned a waiter named Valentino and how awesome he was. I was also curious about the manager, Jennifer, responding to so many customer reviews. I wondered if she even existed. I knew we had to pay them a visit. Let me say wow, wow, wow!!!!! Making the reservation was a breeze both times. I had to call and reschedule and they had no problem with that. Our reservation was for 7:45 PM. Perfect for seeing all the lights of Vegas get brighter. The view of the strip was great. But the view of the fountains at the Bellagio was simply amazing. Guess who came to our table as our waiter.....Valentino himself. What I had read about him did not do him justice. He was great. He was so attentive to everything. He was not too loud, not too quiet. He seemed to know exactly the evening we needed to experience. I actually told him that I had read about him in some reviews and he seemed genuinely excited. The food was amazing, too. My wife had the rabbit prepared 3 different ways. I had the filet mignon, but being from Texas where we know beef, it wasn't quite what I expected. But everything else was wonderful. We actually had 3 desserts!!!! They were unbelievable. Guess who else came to our table.....Jennifer, the manager. She does exist. She wanted to make sure everything was great and it was. She did not just breeze by either. She visited with us for few minutes and she, too, was amazed that we had read about Valenino on this site and then had him as our waiter. Overall truly an amazing night. It wasn't just a meal. It was a night full of memories that my wife and I will remember for a lifetime thanks to all the staff.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We stuck with the Eiffel Affair cocktail at $12 a piece instead of spending $100 for our very familiar $15 bottle of wine, which would make each glass $25. The waiter was well familiar with the menu, which was nice. My husband ordered the duck and was very pleased with it. I had the rabbit and it was very nice as well. The best part is really the view of the Bellagio fountains. Once is probably enough though.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

So i was excited to eat here because i read all the reviews that it was good. The food was nothing special!! For the price, it wasn't worth it!! My fish wasn't even cooked, you can see the it was still raw inside(pink). My husband ordered the prime ribeye he didn't enjoyed, and my husband isn't picky at all. Our waiter told us that the meals came with a side dish. Well when we got our bill they charged us the side dishes. Our waiter wasn't good at all. I don't recommend this restaurant!! Las Vegas has a lot of really good restaurants. If you want a restaurant to see the fountains, try the restaurants at the Bellagio!! We ate at The top of the world restaurant at Stratosphere, that was the best meal!!!</review><polarity>-1</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

How many ways can I gush about the Eiffel Tower restaurant? My husband made the reservations and I was happy to go to this place. We were treated very warmly upon arrival. The hostess was lovely, as was the bartender who served us cocktails while we briefly waited for a table (which was a fantastic one looking at the Bellagio fountains). Ou server was the awesome Velentino... he did not overlook a single detail for us all the evening. He was great and we were sooo well looked after. We eat out often and we travel often and this, no word of an exaggeration, was our BEST MEAL EVER!!!! I had the blue cheese souffle and my husband had the scallops... both were delicious. Even the bread and butter was delicious! (the bread comes to your table and there are 4 fresh choices and the butter is specially ordered from France; I think it is called Pologne butter).We had a wonderful bottle of wine (Caymus Cabernet) with our entree. We both had the filet mignon. It was so delicious that after every bite, you kind of had to put down your knife and fork and just sit back in your chair and savour it while you ate. Unbelievable! For dessert we had creme brulee and a caramel souffle. Heavenly! The souffle came to the table and as the caramel was poured into the centre of it, it rose and puffed up even more. It was the kind of night where you are so full... but the food is so darn delicious that you still keep eating because you know this is a rare, special night - it isn't just anywhere you can find food this well prepared. I loved Vegas more after eating here. Warm thanks to the chef and our server Valentino but an unforgettable evening.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Our reservation was at 5pm and we were seated right away. The view of the Strip was very nice but since it wasn't dark yet, it wasn't as spectacular as it would have been if all the lights of Vegas were on. We did not have a window seat, instead we were seated next to some heavy beams that blocked a lot of our view. The service was very good and the staff was extremely friendly. The food was just OK. I orderd the rib eye that was suggested by our waiter. It was not cooked to my liking, the sauce was bland and it wasn't even warm. I would have sent it back but we were pressed for time. My husband didn't like his meal either but the other couple we were with seem to like theirs. If I had to do it over again, I would come up here for drinks and appetizers only and enjoy the view. The food downstairs at Mon Ami Gabi is much better.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

But stay away from the food. The vine however was great. Also the A/C was on full go, so I was cold into my bones that day. There was nothing they could do about it. The casino under the restaurant had the power over how much air and how cold air that was pumped out. So if u get a window seat u might get a really really cold experience. They also forgot our cheeseplate, but we didnt really care cus all we wanted to do was to get out of there and get thawed. The servant we had did however bring me a shal and for that they get 2 tripadvisor dots and not one. He was very polite and helpful.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Based on past reviews, I was careful to book an early reservation (5:30 pm) so we could get a table with a view, which we did, and the view is definitely worth it. We also went on a weekday which may help since they are probably not as busy then. All the staff were very friendly, so no complaints there. I will agree that the food and especially the drinks are very expensive, but everything tasted and looked great. We had the salmon and the chicken entries with a couple of side dishes, but you don't really need to order sides with these if you have appetizers first and you probably should save room for a dessert (they are worth the cost). We didn't bother with the souffles as the other desserts looked much more appealing and they were great!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Worth it? Sure - why not. The view is worth the price and the service is good except for us when there was a disconnect between the kitchen and the server and it look an hour and 20 minutes to get our entrees. Everyone apologetic, free desserts etc etc - but still, not something I expect at a fine dining restuarant.

But I have been to very few that are attentive to the ENTIRE dining experience like the Eiffel Tower Restaurant. From the minute you step up to the elevator you feel completely taken care of. The GM, Lyle Tolhurst, is absolutely amazing. As is the rest of his staff. The sommelier, Brian, is the best I have encountered.Anything I can say is an understatement. The food, the service, the atmosphere, the attention to detail....there just aren't enough adjectives....perfect, amazing, incredible. The only way I know to say it is that it's as if the entire restaurant and staff had partnered with us to provide a perfectly magical evening. They almost seemed emotionally invested in our special occasion. I simply cannot say enough. This was our second of what will surely be many visits to Eiffel Tower.The prices are exactly what I'd expect for a fine dining experience of this caliber. And I would consider them to be reasonable considering there have been times at other establishments I've actually paid more for less. I've been to places where my money was seemingly spent on the cache of a trendy name as opposed to quality and service. In conclusion, this is a place to indulge, to be pampered, to be taken care of, to have an experience with loved ones that you'll all remember for the rest of your lives. Let the Eiffel Tower Restaurant be part of one of your special memories. You'll be glad you did.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

When we entered the main lobby to the Paris Hotel, we found what looked like the elevator shaft, but were told that we had to go around to the back side to find the maitre d' stand. From there we were whisked to the second floor, with the elevator door opening onto an open kitchen and a smiling hostess who escorted us around the corner into the restaurant. To the left of the entrance there is a wrap-around bar and to the right is the main dining room with tiered levels--cozy banquettes on the top tier, large tables on the main floor, and intimate tables next to the plate glass windows. We had a reservation for 5 o'clock, when the restaurant opens for dinner, and were lucky enough to get a small table overlooking the Bellagio Fountains. The fountains are amazing from street level, but to see them from up high with a panoramic view at sunset was incredible. The menu is a la carte, with all items priced separately. I would recommend going to the restaurant website to look at the menu, that way you will have an idea of what you might want to order and you won't have sticker shock when you actually arrive at the restaurant. As everyone says, dinner is very pricey. I think an average meal with drinks, dinner, tax and tip will run $100 pp. It's definitely a special-occasion dining experience, and the wait staff works very hard to make you feel special. Our waiter was very gracious, and even though she looked busy she happily took the time to take our picture. Also, towards the end of our dinner the manager came through the restaurant greeting guests, inquiring after their meals, and handing out his business card. For dinner, my husband ordered the house salad and the beef short ribs, which were tender and tasty. As a vegetarian, I chose the spring pea soup and the artichoke crepes. I was a little worried because sometimes vegetarian food is not that flavorful, but the crepes were delicious. The slow roasted tomato coulis was especially good. Before our meal a server brought around a tray of freshly baked breads for our selection, and we were also served a chilled carrot soup amuse bouche. After dinner the wait staff crumbed the table before serving us our passionfruit souffle. Also, for those diners celebrating a special occasion, the kitchen sends out a small chocolate mousse with "Happy Birthday" or "Happy Anniversary" written around the rim of the plate.Even though it was a Saturday night and the restaurant was filling up, we never felt rushed. You could easily spend 2 1/2 to 3 hours at dinner. We had tickets to a show so we didn't want to linger, but it was nice that the whole experience felt very relaxed and leisurely. The restaurant also carries on the French tradition of a bathroom attendant who personally hands you a towel to dry your hands and offers an array of perfumes and lotions for your use. Unfortunately I had forgotten to tuck a few dollars into my clutch before leaving our hotel room.The Eiffel Tower restaurant is an event dining experience with beautiful views of the Bellagio Fountains, delicious food, and attentive service. If you don't care to invest that much time or money into dinner, you may want to consider going for lunch or for drinks at the bar, both would be more affordable but with the same amazing views. Whenever you go, though, you will be able to experience a little bit of Paris without the hassle of jetlag or a passport.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The food was very good, we had from the set menu, and can't really fault it although its a little top end price wise. The service was pretty good, a little overly attentive, but its better than being left waiting all nights, also as we had tickets to see a show we did need to be out on time so it helped.Just as a word of warning take a jacket as the resaurant is very overly air-conditioned....I know its hot in Vegas, but if your in the good seats by the windows your right on the vents so it can get chilly.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

I had read some reviews that said you paid for the view at this restaurant, not the food quality. Well, I strongly disagree. The food was delicious! I had a halibut dish and the middle-of-the-deset fish tasted as fresh as the seafood I get here in Boston. As a treat for our anniversary, the staff even treated us to a small after-dinner dessert. I was greatly impressed by every element of this meal. The decor, the view, the amazing staff and service, the great food, all perfect.

My husband and I were in Las Vegas with his nephew and wife to celebrate a 30th birthday. We chose the Eiffel Tower to celebrate this special occasion. If you want to guarantee yourself a table along the window, you need to arrive when the restaurant opens at 5:00, which is what we did. They have tables of two or four along the window, which gives you the best view of the strip and specifically the Bellagio fountain show (fabulous). My husband and I had reviewed the menu on line prior to arriving so we knew what to expect. We found the service was excellent and included a discussion with the sommelier. When we first arrived the shades were drawn but once the sun set they were raised and we enjoyed the view immensely. We all ordered drinks, shared a bottle of wine, appitizers, main course, sides and dessert. I had mentioned in my reservation we were celebrating a birthday and the server brought a special birthday dessert out for our nephew. We also ordered creme brule, which we were advised they need 30 minute lead time to prepare, so this was done when we ordered our meals. Our meals were fabulous, the best beef tenderloin I have ever had, prepared exactly as I had requested. Everything was a la carte but the sides we ordered were enough for the four of us to share. Our dining experience lasted almost 3 1/2 hours and we enjoyed every minute of it. The restaurant was packed when we left, including many people waiting at the bar to get a table in the dining room. Note that men are required to wear pants and collared shirts. We enjoyed the opportunity of dressing up!Highly recommend dining at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant while you are in Las Vegas.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Several complaints, but visits from wait staff and managers just made them louder. We were seated a level below them for dinner. The views of the fountains were amazing, and the service was above par, but mediocre food and the very loud drunks quickly made the meal a bad experience. Finally the loud group left, dessert arrived and life was good again. I won't return only because there are too many fabulous restaurants in Vegas.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The main attraction is the view over the Bellagio fountains and the window tables directly overlook it. They have packed in a lot of tables, however, so you are right up against your neighbours and, in our case, the serving station. Food is OK, although not as good as the price tag suggests. None of the main courses come with accompaniments so you need to shell out an extra $10 a portion for vegetables and it's easy to see how the price can rack up. I would give it two stars for the general experience and an extra star for the view of the fountains.</review><polarity>0</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

Pricey!!</title><review>We stayed at the Paris hotel and thought we'd try this restaurant. We go to Vegas a lot and had never tried it. We heard that it was good, but pricey. I'd have to agree. The food was really good and we had great service. The wine list is extensive. We bought one of the cheaper bottles of wine and it was still great. If you are going to go here and pay the prices, make sure that you make a reservation and request to be by the window. That view is worth paying for. It over-looks the strip as well as the fountain show at the Bellagio. For an appetizer we got the crab salad and blue cheese soufflé. I wouldn't order the crab again. For dinner we got the chicken and we were between the famous beef wellington and the short ribs. Our waiter talked us out of the beef Wellington (love an honest waiter) and we were very happy! For dessert we had the grand marnier soufflé. Yum.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

My friends I were with were from Scotland and unfamiliar with wines from my state. It was an excellent wine, but not for that price. I can strongly recommended the dessert ... had chocolate/port cake with shaved dark chocolate for $12 (this was worth every penny) with coffee. Because there was group of us we did not have a clear view. My suggestion would be to come for dessert and coffee if you must come. Stay away from the rest the of menu..

I recommend making reservations. We had dinner right before going to see Jersey Boys which started at 7pm and had plenty of time to eat dinner comfortably. It is a fancy restaurant but dress code is casual dressy. I saw a lady with denim capris and flip flops. So if you go in with jeans but dressed up you won't feel out of place. We spend $280 for just the TWO of us. Filet mignon is awesome with red wine sauce. Surf and turf is DEFINITELY not worth the $74. It was delicious but not worth that amount of money. Our waiter was very nice. He was French (so he was a bit uptight, no humor). Half the staff seemed uptight too (perhaps because it is such a fancy restaurant) and the other half was realy great(but its still a fancy restarunat, weird). Would not go back but only because of how expensive it was. Great one time experience though.

The Foi Gras was the best I have had outside of Paris, it was complimented nicely with an fig jam reduction with a rough texture to go with the smooth texture of the foi gras. My steak was amazing, my wife's fish was great. The service was outstanding, they gave us a special dessert on the plate lettered in chocolate was "Happy 17th wedding anniversary".

Asked for a window seat over-looking Bellagio fountains which was granted.Service was excellent. Had the snapper and wife had the rib eye. Both were very good. The best part of the meal was the Soufflé that we both had. Nice upsell they pull, waiter mentions during initial order that soufflés are available but that they take a while to prepare, so if we desire same we need to order now. I bet they sell more than they would if people ate and were full and then were presented with desert choices. The Caesar salads were served with anchovy in the dressing which I very much prefer. I think they do a nice job here. I would rate 4.5 out of 5, but as it is not available, and I also dined at Top of the World which was truly a 4, I must give Eiffel Tower a 4.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Our bill for 4 was $880 but this was not our problem. We ordered the set menu with the wine pairing. The food was poor and a number of our dishes were served cold. The sides in some cases were almost unedible. The wine was served not out of the bottle but out of a small glass flask which I have never seen at any tasting menu anywhere in the world. The waiter was robotic,plastic and annoying. This restaurant charges prices to compare with the likes of the PIcasso restaurant but offers food and service like some of the downtown budget places. If you want a treat I would suggest you look elsewhere.</review><polarity>-1</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

The ambiance is wonderful for a couple. The view overlooking the Bellagio fountain is breathtaking. The food was just average for such a high priced restaurant. The waiter was a little arrogant to us. We are meat and potato people from Ohio, and frankly didn't even know what some of the items were on the menu. We both ordered the filet, and I ordered a potato side dish (it had a fancy name but tasted just like scalloped potatoes), and when my husband asked for the same side, the waiter told him that my dish would be enough for two and would not let him order his own. When the meal came, the one side dish of potatoes that we had to share was just one spoonfull for each of us. The steak was just an average filet, nothing special. We then ordered the chocolate souffle because I've never had one, and to me it tasted exactly like hot co co wheats cereal. We payed a lot of money for a great atmosphere.</review><polarity>0</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

This should have been challenged by staff on 2 counts, firstly the obvious danger of scalding from hot food being carried to tables and the comfort of all guests.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Staff were friendly and efficient - although there was a half-hearted attempt at up-selling, it wasn't intrusive and we weren't made to feel unwanted for not ordering everything off the menu. Service seemed a little rushed at first but in the end we stayed at our table chatting over a glass of wine until well after the meal, and there was no attempt to get rid of us or make us feel uncomfortable (at least, if there was I didn't notice). And the food - very good, and in reasonable quantities - the scallop starter and the lamb and sole mains were particularly memorable. A good (though not cheap) spot for a celebration.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

I probably ordered the wrong thing which was a type of fish with vegetables. It came in a little baking bag which the waiter cut open at the table. It reminded me of how I use to cook fish or beef ten years ago. For dinner it will cost about $75 per person. I ate at The Mesa Grill at Caesars and thought the food was better there.

First of all the view experience makes you feel like you are sitting in a crowded auditorium. The seats are so close to each other and there is no privacy. It appears they have tried to crowd as many seats and tables to give as many people as possible the "view". The food is definitely not worth the price. The first thing I noticed was the torn carpet that made the restaurant even more unattractive. I had called and told them my husband was celebrating his 50th birthday and if I could have a dessert served, with his name and happy 50th birthday. He received this little shot glass of a dessert with the words... happy birthday written on the plate with no mention of his name and the birthday he was celebrating. I don't mind paying the price when the food and experience is exceptional, this was not!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We had a table overlooking the Bellagio Fountains, which was a great way to see them, but the views up and down the strip were frankly better up in the air than down below!

We made our reservation for after a show and to be honest if you prefer to eat later I would recommend getting a 930 or later reservation. The restaurant gets quieter as you dine which was very nice. We selected the tasting menu which was a delicious and creative 6 course dining experience starting with appetizer and ending with a beautiful dessert. It was a bit more expensive then just a meal a la carte, however we figured since this would probably be a once in a lifetime experience for us we wanted to taste a little of everything. Our total dining time with the tasting menu was about 2 hours. I highly recommend that you make a reservation and if you have a small party request a window view of the Bellagio water show. That was so fun to watch while eating our wonderful food. Don't worry if you cannot get a window seat though the entire restaurant has amazing views. If you are planning something special or romantic this is the place to go all out. Yes its an expensive visit, but the experience is worth every penny!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Not that I eat anything in front of me, but I don't see value in certain things. And this restaurant is part of it.Food is a-ok, if you're not a French cuisine enthusiast. Especially if you're not willing to spend A LOT of money eating. The views are nice, though. But the staff... meh. Might be something for people to experience France: you definitely get the attitude from the waiters as you'd get in France!Another thing that bothered was that, when I made the reservation over the phone, I specifically asked if there was anything in particular I needed to know about the dinner. They told me there wasn't and that I just had to show up on time for the reservation.Then when I get there, they only allowed me to enter the restaurant if I accepted to BORROW a blazer, because they had a dress code, which WAS NOT mentioned to me. I have no issues with dress code. I think each restaurant is entitled to enforce whatever code they want.But I definitely did NOT like being the idiot inappropriately dressed for dinner. Plus, wasn't a lot of fun to wear a blazer that who knows when it was last cleaned. Anyway, if you want to show off and spend a lot of money - or just speak French to other people, that's the place for you!</review><polarity>0</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

We had dinner here on our wedding anniversary. Food was really good and the staff were very attentive. We mentioned it was our anniversary when we went to look at the menu to decide where we wanted to go for our meal. We were invited up to have a look at the restaurant. After that we just booked it because it looked very nice and the menu looked nice too. They must have noted that it would be our anniversary as all the staff came up to congratulate us. Other people say that it is very expensive but if you want a really good meal for a special occasion you have to pay for it. We actually didn't think it was overly expensive, you get what you pay for.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We took the suggestion to just walk-in and wait at the bar. We noted that many people chose to dine at the bar as it has the same menu and you could see the water fountain show even sitting at the bar (not all seats of course, but I think some may have better views than certain tables). We eventually got a table by the window after we ordered appetizer. The nightview of sin city is just so spetecular with or wihout the water fountain show right accross the street from us. Compared to the appetizer and main courses, the desert seemed to be a bit ordinary. But we were very happy with the food overall, given the price we paid. The service was great and everyone in the dining room seems to be happy. It is a very romantic place for a couple to enjoy a nice dinner.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We arrived late in the evening and without reservations, on a quiet week for Vegas. We waited at the bar for a while until a table by the window was available. We chatted to the bartender while we waited for a table by the window, and he recommended the cod dish, but we were in the mood for steak--well, we should have listen to the bartender--as the two different steak dishes we ordered were below average (and the price was above average). I would recommend you skip the steak dishes...or skip dinner all together and the price tag, and just grab one of the four bar-stools that face the Bellagio fountains (the rest of the bar-stools do not look directly over the view).</review><polarity>0</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

It is a very busy restaurant, definitely make reservations before you go. We arrived and waited a little bit for our table. We were there on Christmas Day so it might have been more packed than usual. It was a bit of a zoo at the front "foyer" area but everything was good once we sat down. The portions are quite big so we all ordered appetizers and the girls shared mains. For the price, it's good for Vegas.

The food is also amazing! I had a center cut ribeye that was topped with escargot and mushrooms, which was fantastic, and my husband had the NY Strip. Both steaks were cooked perfectly.

If you have your fat wallet with you, it is a very nice place, with good food and service. There is an impressive exhibition kitchen, you can see, as you get off the elevator, with all copper cookware , that is impressive Maitre D is in tuxedo attire so wear your best. No jeans, etc.!

We didn't get too crazy as we spent the morning at the Paris buffet so we were still a bit full but we wanted to sample something different. She had a sweet tooth and opted for the creme brulee. I opted for other light fare which was the half avocado stuffed with crab appetizer. This place is apparently well known for its creme brulee and I must say that the presentation of this dish is superb. The vote from my girlfriend was a resounding two-thumbs-up, as she savored it with her eyes closed. Wow, that must be good! She is about as picky as they come when she eats. My dish was equally presented well with very crispy shreds of iceberg lettuce surrounding the avocado and a heaping pile of a crab/mayonnaise mixture which I found to be very light tasting despite it's rich texture. The avocado was also a perfect consistency and it's buttery taste went a long way to compliment the crab mixture. Excellent! This place is not an inexpensive stop as my lunch appetizer was at $18 on recollection, so if you are looking for general fare this might not be your stop. If, however, you are looking for more high-end, SUPER high-quality food though, you should definitely try this restaurant. Reservations are highly suggested to avoid the wait from general curiosity seekers at the casino floor.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

When we got to the restaurant we were impressed with the beauty of the restaurant and I was impressed by the courteousness and attentiveness of the wait staff, but we were not given our window seat, and in fact were quite far away from a window. It ruined the celebration mood we were in and put a damper on our evening. The food we got was good, but, by the time it came to our table it was slightly cold. Overall I would attempt to go there 1 more time, but if I was disappointed again, I wouldn't go back. It was quite an expensive meal to be that disappointed.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We arrived at our allotted time, 8.45 pm, to be told there would be at least a twenty minute wait and that would not be for a window table. We told the server that was unacceptable, and why had they taken our booking if they could not then provide a table. There were two other couples sitting on a bench seat waiting and people at the bar who obviously had taken the news in better spirit and bought drinks (which is what I suspect the restaurant wants to achieve by booking you in for a table they don't have). We complained and the girl serving us called the maitre 'd over who apologised and said she would get us a table as quickly as possible. Which she did, five minutes later we we sat at in the window over-looking the Ballagio fountains. But it had left a nasty taste even at that point. The waiter came bought us water and the wine list and then disappeared for quite a long time, he did not give us menus so we literally were just left to sip our water and watch the fountains - again! When he did come back we gave him our drinks order and told him we were not happy with the service so far. In the meantime the table next to us had been cleared and a couple seated there. The tables are small and VERY close together. So close in fact that the man at the next table thought it was ok to push his chair right back so it was resting on the side of our table and I could not move my arm. his rudeness and lack of consideration is not the restaurant's fault but the tables are very close to 'pack em in'. It was the last straw and when the waiter came back with the drinks we told him we were leaving. Having read reviews our experience was not unique and I accept most people have a good one, indeed my husband did on his first visit. It was just very disappointing. I think maybe the tables not in the window maybe more comfortable and warmer, and the entire restaurant is tiered so you can see outside and watch the fountains if that floats your boat. I didn't think the restaurant was particularly romantic, much too big for that, but great for groups as was my husband's experience.Anyway we left and headed back for the MOzen restaurant in the Mandarin, interestingly they have far more positive comments on Trip Advisor than this restaurant but are further down the league table because they are new kids on the block and have less reviews.</review><polarity>-1</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

We waited about 20 mins for our table ( we wanted to wait for one with a view) so we had a drink up at the bar…prices weren’t cheap but the cocktails were great! We were seated in one of the best tables of the restaurant looking straight over to the Bellagio and the fountain show. While the restaurant was busy it was still lovely and romantic. The wait stuff really knew their way around the menu and were able to pair our selection with a great bottle of red wine. When I booked I let them know it was my husbands birthday that night and they didn’t forget and ended our meal with a chocolate mousse with a happy birthday message which was really lovely. Now the food…wow!! My husband is an ex chef so he has high standards… we couldn’t fault a thing, Our tip.. make sure you order the chocolate soufflé for dessert, it was to die for!!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

This is not somewhere to take your children unless they are used to fine dining in an adult atmosphere. For a very special occasion, you will delight the graduate or the college student, but otherwise save this restaurant for those who want to enjoy their companions at dinner. Lighting is subdued, service is prime, and the dinner will be quite special. There are many wonderful restaurants in Las Vegas and you should include this one in your selections.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

I am attaching my reply to the thank you email I received. I have yet to receive a reply.Hi Lyle,I appreciate your email and was going to post my comments on trip advisor but will share them privately with you first. The overall ambience for the evening was very good as was the entertainment. Our waitress was pleasant however I do have some negative comments. The first is timing, our reservation was 6:15 and we did not finish until 9 this is far too long with 20+ minute breaks between courses. The tables surrounding us came after and left before we did. We commented before our main entrée that the tables beside us were finishing dessert and then the entrée came right away but truthfully we should not need to point this out. My largest comment is on the wine pairing which both my wife and I ordered. We chose the same selections and when the wine was presented we receive half of one serving bottle each or ¼ glass. I personally feel at this price point that we should enjoy a normal serving of each choice. So in conclusion for an $800 plus evening I feel disappointed in the experience overall. I look forward to your reply.Regards,</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We'd made reservations in advance and chose to wait a few extra minutes for a table right on the window. The restaurant overlooks the Bellagio Fountains so you see a fantastic water and lights show every 15 minutes. While this entertainment made the dining experiene special, the food made it extraordinary. We had a treat of two extra courses -- a starter from the chef of a chilled soup and then a small trio of appetizers. I had the Beef Wellington which featured a fantastic filet wrapped inside a delicate puff pastry. Save room for dessert -- I highly recommend the a souffle -- I loved the chocolate one. As if you actually had any room left in your after the amazing meal, they serve you a small plate of chocolates with your meal -- also fabulous. While the food is a bit pricey versus some other options on the strip, the view and the quality of the food make it worth every cent. Be sure to ask the chef for any favorite recipes (he sent via email) or buy the cookbook. We loved it so much, we then went the next day to their sister restaurant - Mon Ami Gabi at the base of the Eiffel Tower and sat on the patio for dinner the next night.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Once we went up, the doors opened upon the kitchen, so everyone thought we were on the wrong floor. I don't know why there are not signs. Perhaps they don't want to attract gamblers who might just stroll in there? Once we found the restaurant, everything was flawless. The service, the food, the view, none of these can be beat. One minor detail: the pix-fixe menu mentioned that a souffle could be added for dessert for $8. We did not get the prix-fixe, but added it to our regular dinner. They were $15 each. We knew going in that it was going to be expensive, but if you need to know the exact amount, I think the menu was a bit misleading.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

You are greeted by a hostess in front of the elevator. Then as soon as you get up to the restaurant you are once again greeted by a new face. As soon as you get off the elevator you get a glimpse of the kitchen and see them hard at work. There is a bar as soon as you get to the restaurant. The restaurant itself is a decent size all seated just right to get a good view of the Bellagio. The best seating though is near the window to see the Fountain show at 6pm. Let me tell you what a show to watch while you're eating-it was awesome! The server was super attentive. There is a separate server if you order wine--that is the first time I've experienced that. He is the one that comes to your table after the bottle's been opened to top off your glasses during your meal. So the service was the best. Food was very good ---the presentation superb. I ordered the duck and was cooked to perfection! What you MUST try is the Grand Marnier Souffle` ....which you must order at the time you place your meal. The experience was great, the service was great, the food was great....the only thing....that it is TOO expensive.

We had a romantic dinner here on a Saturday night in January. We made reservations for 5:00 p.m. because it is the time the restaurant opens and to ensure both a good table overlooking the Bellagio fountains and to see the sunset. Arrived right at 5 and we were sat immediately at a table right along the edge of the room overlooking the fountains which is one of the reasons we came here. It looks like if there are more than two in your party then you won't get one of these tables as all the ones along the windows were for couples. The service was great and very attentive. They serve your choice of four different breads along with your meal. I ordered the Filet Mignon which was excellent and perfectly cooked (medium) and my spouse ordered the Snapper. I didn't try it but he said it was very good. I regret not ordering the tasting menu with a wine pairing because I wanted to try more food but we were on our way to another event with food and wine and didn't want to over indulge too early. Our dining experience took almost two hours and probably would have been longer if we had done the other menu and wine. When we left we checked out the kitchen while waiting for the elevator. It is bright white and appears very clean. Interesting to see all the different meals being prepared.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The food was very good but the price was a little high for what you got. Filet and prime rib were $54.00 each just for the meat. Then 10.00 each for potatoes. $15.00 for one dessert. I knew it was going to be high when I went in but thought maybe the price would include a little more? We did go by the dress attire as suggested and this was well suited for the atmosphere and when men and women showed up wearing jeans and tennis shoes I thought that was just not right. Come on people!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

My only complaint was that a young couple brought a baby with them to dinner (not sure why in a place like this). The baby cried for an extended period of time which was very annoying. Management did not make any move to suggest they move into the hall or away from tables. Service and food both very good.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

You make your way up the elevator and are immediately greeted by someone who takes your coat and leads you to your table, or in our case, since we were a bit early, to the bar. The bar is nice, great view of the city, top shelf. Once our table was ready, they came for us, transferred our bar tab and took our drinks and us to our cozy table for two, overlooking the fountains. It's a beautiful view. The fountains go off. Impressive. Ordering al la carte is not cheap. We opted for the tasting menu ($93.00 pp) WITH their optional wine pairing ($65.00 pp)...This is a great DEAL people. An appetizer and entree would have been almost as much and we had 5 decent courses of beautifully prepared foods, beautifully presented. Now that said, the wines were decent but not what anyone would call fabulous; although I found their pairing of the seafood bisque with a Tawny Port, right on!Have you ever seen the show "Hello Dolly"? Remember the waiter scene, waiters doing the waiter dance with trays held over their heads? While service was prompt and well timed, there was also a frantic feeling of the waiter dance...and those trays, held over their heads, were happening over our heads and close to our back. A little disconcerting. But nothing was dropped or dripped on us so that was a good thing. And remember those fountains at the Bellagio? Well, those suckers go off every 15 minutes...so after the first few times...it's like sitting in front of a clock. "Has it been 15 minutes already?" With a large group, or even maybe a new man (or woman) in your life, that may not be noticed so much, but after 23 years of talking, sometimes you just look at the view, over and over.The food was good, a well thought out menu, nicely, although unevenly presented. My plate came looking one way, his a bit different. If you are serving two plates of the same thing side by side, they should look exact replicas of each other...at least at this level of service and presentation. Denny's...not so much.LindySez: It's a nice date night. Great food, great view, if you have something to talk about after the 6th time the fountains go off or, as in our case, talking about the fountains going off...and great service (see if we had been paying attention to the view, we probably wouldn't have even noticed "Hello Dolly" was being played out behind us.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We weren't seated until nearer to 10pm at a table that had been shoved in, with one member of the group squashed beside part of the tower's angle poles.Our waitress had a knack of disappearing. It took about half an hour to get menus or anyone's attention. When the food arrived our waitress again disappeared and check the dishes were alright. As three of the dishes (venison) turned up cold and needed to be sent back we had to hunt down other staff members. The venison was taken away and reheated, we were not offered freshly cooked meat. They came back tough and one dish was inedible.If you want a soufle for desert (which were delicious) we were told to order them before the mains turned up, as they take 25 minutes. The deserts turned up before all the mains did! The restaurant had to re-do them.Poor service, bad timing, invisible waitress, cold food.

This is a good place to try something new, because whatever you order, it will be well prepared and tasty. Don’t pass on the Peekytoe (Atlantic Rock) Crab appetizer, it is very tasty.

Service was impeccable. Food was brilliant. Wine was beautiful. Dessert was killer.I've read many reviews on this restaurant, and we have to get a few things straight: fine dining that costs a couple $275 + tip does not mean you eat all you can stuff in. Fine dining means the best ingredients prepared skillfully and presented artfully in an atmosphere where the finer things in life are greatly appreciated.The Eiffel Tower Restaurant at Paris Las Vegas does this well amid surroundings that are less than angelic.My wife's lamb and my filet mignon were about as good as it gets. Both were served very pink and melt in your mouth tender.My winter greens salad and my wife's spinich salad were spot on.....with just enough dressing drizzled over......JUST enough......JUST the way it should be.The sides were O.K.....but not fantastic.We shared a bottle of Storybook cellars Zinfindel.......excellent.Bread was an ever-circling-the-room basket of different selections.For dessert, my wife had the creme brulee and I had something I had never had before......an individual baked Alaska-type dessert that had passion fruit sorbet inside. Somehow the sweet tang of the passion fruit went very well with the slightly sweet, toasted meringue.Reservations are a must if you want any hope of scoring a good table. It seemed all the tables around us had their own server......a very special touch in a cheesy, plastic-is-beautiful city.One GREAT winter tip: Space your meals the day you go to the Eiffel Tower Restaurant so that your reservations are at opening time....5 p.m. You will most likely get a front row table for 2 overlooking the Bellagio fountains AND it will be well past dark by the time dessert is served. Hope you guys were paying attention.......I'm sure the ladies were.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

I wanted something different for my annual trip to Vegas with my wife, so we skipped going to a show and splurged on dinner instead. Trusting the Trip Advisor community of reviews was the best decision I recently made. My original impression of Paris Las Vegas was that the Eiffel Tower Restaurant (ETR) was a gimmick just to oversell you food with a view. How happy I am now that I was SO wrong in this case.I "liked" ETR on Facebook and began the process of making a reservation by e-mailing the manager, Lyle Tolhurst, a month before our visit. I requested a date and time (6:45 pm sunset was a good pick), and he was prompt in his reply with a reservation. Upon arrival, we had rose petals scattered at our table with a panoramic view of the Strip, facing the fountains of Bellagio and the new Cosmopolitan. Quite the romantic ambience. Our waiter David was well equipped with top customer service skills, friendly and personable, with just enough conversation for a peaceful evening. Bus staff was attentive with the crumb sweepers, refilling wine and sparkling water.We had Le (tasting) Menu of the night, with highlights being the selections of BREAD, Warm Maine Lobster Salad, Olive Oil Poached Halibut, Veal Medallions, and Crispy Farmstead Artisanal Camembert. Even at $98 pp, cheeses/salad for $12 extra, and Souffle for an extra $8, I consider this meal and experience now in my Top Five dining experiences of my life. Well worth EVERY dollar and penny in my foodie opinion. Since we had such an amazing dining time, we had our photo taken, which they posted later on Facebook, and we bought a copy in the card frame for a keepsake... a rare instance for me.I've gone to plenty of other trendy restaurants in Vegas (Mix, Olives, Circo) and felt underserved and robbed of a good food and experience value for the excessive money spent. ETR surprised, exceeded, and made me feel wonderful as I left in deep appreciation for the service that Lyle and his staff given us and his other diners. It is simply how fine dining should be done, leaving out the pompous, over-hyped and too-cool-for-school attitude . Cheers to Eiffel Tower Restaurant, and please keep up the fantastic work!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

All of the meals that we have eaten there have been good. The restaurant also has a very nice wine list. What really makes this place a cut above is the atmosphere/view (obviously). It is certainly worth giving it a try if you have never been before. We travel to Vegas several times a year and every so often we squeeze this place into our dining list to enjoy great food and superb views. If you have not been, go at least once. The type of people that frequent this restaurant tend to be on the touristy side, often going just for the scenery, but it is still an elegant place to enjoy fine cuisine.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Our food was perfect, they had given us a table looking directly over the bellagio fountains, it was amazing!! The staff couldn't do enough for you. Then after we finished they brought us a small pudding free of charge with " happy anniversary" scrolled around the plate in chocolate sauce. The views over the strip are brilliant!! Lovely lovely place!!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

It was not liked by any of them. The salmon was good. Souffle was really good.

The friend that we were traveling with, had made the reservation months before, and asked for a window table, only to be told that this could not be guaranteed, but if we came early we would have a better chance. We got there at 6h30, and the restaurant was already pretty busy. We were taken to our table – a booth on the second row from the windows. Although we could see the fountains, my wife was very disappointed. Moments after we sat down, the window table in front of us cleared and I quickly asked to be moved there. Our waiter inquired at the Maitre D and returned to tell us that the table was already promised to someone. How can that be when apparently we cannot reserve a window table months ahead? It ended up that a couple already sitting at a window table a little further was moved to this table. And yes it could have fit the 4 of us, because later on they did sit a party of four. My wife was then extremely upset, since we had booked over 4 months ago and she was so looking forward to this evening. She did not want to ruin the evening so she did let it go.On another note, the service was good, although we did feel a bit rushed. We were eating our main course, after having had an appetizer, one hour after we sat down. We wanted to make it an evening, but it was clear that our table was needed for another sitting. The place was extremely busy and noisy.The food was delicious but my wife’s meal was not hot, barely warm. I did tell our server who immediately took it from her and returned with another plate, much better then. It should not happen in a restaurant like this.My wife and friend had the duck; they were a bit disappointed by the presentation although the flavor was very good. Her husband had le loup de mer and was also a bit disappointed as it was too cooked. I had the rack of lamb, and loved it. The tomato tart was also cold.We did enjoy our evening but we were not overly impressed by this well renown restaurant and the bill was fairly high. Maybe we had set our standards too high.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

On that occasion we had a table against the window with a beautiful view of the strip and Bellagio Fountains.The meal then was expensive but the considering the overall experience, which was just that little bit special compared to the norm, it was worth it.On our recommendation our friends booked a table (for 6 of us) after their wedding at the MGM Grand. We were shown to our elevated table, three of us had strip / fountain views, three of us faced our friends. We chose the set menu on the recommendation of the waiter after our great deliberations. Service was efficient, the food was nice albeit a little rich in flavour and this was the theme for the 90 minutes or so we were there. Whilst I cant fault the food, it was very well done although it was not as special as I remember it being back in 2009. The bill came to approx £100 per head which for what we had was a bit of a shock. The frequently offered bottles of water were charged at £7.50 from memory! The wine list was extensive and with none of us being wine experts the £50 recommended bottle was a territory unmapped for a "party" meal!In retrospect I wish I hadnt recommended the Eiffel Tower, the cost / experience / value just didnt gel for a party of 6 of different tastes. As a venue for a special meal for two or even four then yes. For a meal that was bound to include banter and conversation as opposed to taking time to enjoy the views and the food then it just didnt work for us. Good points...If you like fine food and wine to match and have deep pockets or want that special occasion in Vegas then its a winner and recommended.Bad points...It really is pricey and not a brilliant place to bring a party of people to who the occasion is more of a priority than the food...as this makes ot prohibitively expensive.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Everyone was impressed with not only the view but the food. The Fillet Mignon was like butter and everything from start to finish was a pleasure and a delight. This place is not jut about the view, it is about the service and food aswell. It is a pretty high end French restaurant so be prepared to pay high end prices for wine and food but it is well worth the experience of being served quality food whilst watching the Bellagio fountains going in the background.We would go back next time in Vegas.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We got seated in what we thought was a great spot in the restaurant. As we were enjoying the view of the fountains a large group behind us started ordering shots. We ordered drinks as well and a starter of quail $19. The drinks were very good but pricey at $18 a piece. For dinner I had the beef wellinginton $59 and my husband the filet mignon $54. My husband said his was alright but mine was very strange. It was greasy and just not good. I ended taking the filet out of the pastry and eating that. Back to the noisy table behind us. At this point they became even more loud and continued to order shots. Not only were we annoyed but other patrons were as well. There were many other couples around us trying to have a romantic dinner like us. We finished up dinner and I had preordered the souffle, which was very good. Overall I was disappointed with our choice to come here.Pros: VIEW! The service was good too.Cons: PRICE for the value. I don't mind paying good money, but the food better be good. And we were upset that management didn't do anything to calm the party down behind us which was annoying us and other patrons. The restaurant was full of couples, this was no place for a frat party.We will personally never come back here again. There are way too many other dining options in vegas. If you want a good view of the fountains come up and sit at the bar and have a drink. Then leave.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

An upset stomach (and not booze related!) the next day did not help with the overall impression.Nice view though!ON TIPPING - We are Brits who live in the US, we understand that local waitstaff live on tips and we regularly tip 20% (when the service is good) so to see a fellow Brit loudly complain about the 18% service charge (which was explained on the booking) was not good. Please people, no matter how the food is, the waitstaff were working hard, were friendly and on NYE deserved more - we upped it to 20% !!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The booking process was smooth with great help from Annie. The food was outstanding, My husband and I had the steak and lamb and both were cooked to perfection. All our guests commented on how superb it was, some saying it was the best food they'd eaten.Pierre from Normandy greeted us on arrival and served us all the way through. He was good humoured and brought a warm atmosphere to the table. We were originally advised against speeches due to being in the main dining area but they allowed us to carry on and positioned us well so that we weren't intrusive upon other diners. We hired a small section of the bar to have canapes and mimosas on arrival, which gave us a great opportunity to admire the views of the fountains and surrounding area. We felt is was great value for 12 perfect meals and flawless service. We wouldn't hesitate to recommend this restaurant and we'll happily return one day.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

You will want to dress up if at all possible. I expected "tourist trap," but was surprised. Expect $175/pp including tax and tip with lower cost wine. The scallop/oxtail appetizer and short rib entree were perfect. Souffle dessert (caramel) was the ideal finale. Nearly all tables have strip views. No complaints other than you probably need to go on an expense account if you plan on ordering wine; the markups were huge. Or, call and see if they have a corkage fee and bring your own. Without wine dinner was closer to $100/pp and was worth it. This restaurant could benefit from a wine pairing option with each course.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

It's one of those restaurants you go to for a special occasion because it's unique. When we made the reservation we said it was our anniversary and requested a table by the window so we could watch the fountains at the Bellagio. We had a great view of the fountain. I took lots of pictures and even videoed the show. Almost everyone sitting by us had their camera out during the show. So don't feel timid about using your camera. You payed for the great view. You might as well get a record of it. I had the warm foie gras and my husband had the escargots. The portions for we're small for the price. If I'm paying $28 for foie gras there should be more than a tablespoon size of it on the plate. The escargots were $18 and the portion was half the size of what you would normally get at other French restaurants. I think I wouldn't have mind if both appetizers were wonderful. They were pretty average. I had the duck as my entree and my husband had the monkfish. Again the food was average. Not bursting with flavor. We had the brussels sprouts and the spinach and mushroom gratin as side. The gratin was the best part of the meal! We had coffee and a banana and white chocolate dessert which was quite good. Overall the meal was okay, but not worth the $315 we payed for it. Like I said, we paid for the unique experience and we got a great view of the Bellagio fountains. I don't think we would return again. There are too many good restaurants in Vegas that I would rather spend my money on.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

But we wanted to do something special during our trip to Vegas and after checking out a number of restaurants, we still decided to go here.All I can say is WOW!The entire staff was gracious and kind. Even though we reserved on the same day, we had wonderful window seats that overlooked the Strip, including the Bellagio fountains. Perhaps we were lucky this way becuase our reservation was a little later in the evening.We started off with an amazing celery and chive mouselline, followed by a squash and duck confit soup. The way the soup was served was so elegant yet fun. The mouselline was presented beautifully as well. And delicious all around! Then we had a warm caesar salad. It was quite good - nothing extraordinary - but they used romaine hearts which is crispier and firm. One thing though, there was nothing warm about this salad - I am not sure if the dressing was supposed to be warm. Maybe the cold lettuce cooled it down, or the hot soup we had before made this dressing feel cool. No bother. It was a good salad nonetheless.Then came the main courses - filet mignon with maitre hotel butter and codfish "en papillote". Sensual and wonderful. The wine that our waiter recommended for our contrasting dishes blended perfectly. It was truly heaven in our mouths.Then for dessert, I had the chocolate souffle. It was pretty good - although I've only had souffle one other time, so I don't have much to compare it with.Coffee was standard, unfortunately. It was well prepared, but it didn't have that rich, almost caramel-like flavour that many restaurant coffees seem to have. Also, for some reason I like to drink my coffee in those smaller, roundish cups, not those taller rectangular ones. So I was a bit disappointed when I got my coffee in this standard hotel-shaped cup.But overall, what an amazing meal ! I am still thinking about it 10 days later and we are definitely going back there the next time we are in Vegas.A few pointers:- Get ready to spend your money. You can see the cost of the menu items via their Website, but not the wine list - the Wine is expensive, really expensive.- When you arrive, the hostess might invite you to sit at the bar for a few moments - if you don't feel like drinking right there and then, you can sit on some couches nearby- During the meal, we were told that we had to order the souffle right away so that it would arrive in time for dessert (it takes a while to make!). But I didn't realize that there were other desserts to choose from. We almost felt pushed into ordering the souffle. It's not that much more expensive than the other desserts, and I understand why we had to order it when we did, but I would have preferred a better way to communicate this information... Maybe next time, I would say "OK, but what are the other desserts?"- At most restaurants, they offer you the wine list before you order your meal - but in my opinion the best way to order wine is to know what you are going to eat beforehand. If they give you the wine list first, explain that you would like to deternine what you will order to eat first before selecting the wine - but select the wine at that point so you can start drinking it!- This restaurant has a sommellier (a wine expert) who can help you choose your wine. There's no charge for his services, so if you're not sure, ask for his help!Enjoy and bon appetit!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Fortunately, we got a table by the window (no guarantees, so we lucked out). The food was very good--not great. I have a "splitting" test at all restaurants, since my husband and I frequently split an entree: Do they split the food in the kitchen or make me do the work? FAIL! We ordered a $45 entree (rack of lamb) and they brought out the entree plus two empty plates. At these prices, that is just unacceptable. Our scallops appetizer was very good. The lamb was too salty, but otherwise good. It was served rare (I ordered medium) but they took it back and cooked it some more.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Great location, amazing view of Bellagio fountains, superb and plentiful food but above all else the best service I have ever received in a restaurant. We had the tasting menu - don't eat all day if you want to make it to dessert! Our waiter was called Vicenzo and quite frankly was a masterful throughout - attentive without being overbearing and hugely polite and charming. We were on the last day of our holiday and were planning on using our Thomas Cook credit card - we thought we had enough but were short and I frantically and embarrassingly had to nip downstairs to transfer money to accounts via wifi in order to pay the bill ( restricted the amount of cash on me as our last night and didn't want to risk gambling it all!). Anyway, what was hugely embarrassing was handled with care and subtlety. I'm still hugely embarrassed after such an opulent evening but would like to pass on thanks to Vicenzo for his excellent service. Dine here if you stay in Vegas and request to be looked after by Vicenzo!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

GREAT VIEW, probably the best view of any of the Las Vegas Strip restaurants! If you get a window seat, you have the best view of the Bellagio fountains. The service is great too, very attentive and friendly servers and sommeliers. I believe, most of the times it is super packed and you probably do need a reservation. With an appetizer, entree and wine, you'll probably spend around $100 per head. That said, any meat entree I tasted, was dry, dull and uninteresting. I don't have the urge to use too much sauces that come with the dishes, but I almost had to everytime. Could that just be typical of French food? I hope not. Everything else is great and overwhelming, but the food needs some more work or the menu needs to include a better more flavorful variety.In hindsight, I would've picked a different restaurant for my mom's 60th birthday celebration.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

I indicated that it was for a birthday. The receptionist then said that we could be given a special treat ( I did not expect anything) . When we arrived for dinner at 8 o'clock, this was "treat" was mentioned again by the receptionist.

There is also a continual flow of "cheese puffs" served in lieu of bread. To finish off the meal a mini fancy chocolate is served on a cute little platter.Everything melted in your mouth and was very memorable.

We chose to go the Eiffel Tower restaurant after reading several reviews on here, and we were not disappointed. From the moment we stepped on the elevator till the time we stepped off, we were continually amazed by the level of service we received. Often times when we go to an upscale restaurant, the service is a bit snobby, but not here. The food was really good, but the service and views are what will bring us back next year. Thanks Eiffel Tower restaurant for being AWESOME!!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Lovely view and good service from the wait staff, slow slow Bartender...they should have had 2-3 people working the bar. We usually go to Mon Ami Gabi downstairs and love the food and sitting outside and people watching while we eat. This lovely view of the strip and the bellagio fountains makes for a fun and memorable dining experience. Great cheese buns and mise en bouche to start. I had the steak sandwich,MR, came medium...not terribly exciting but tasty...My spouse had the french onion soup and a burger, both very good.Would go back but probably downstairs to Mon Ami Gabi- I love having lunch in Paris</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Both of us had the tasting menu, which was excellent. We had a wonderful waiter (whom I'm sure gave us his name, but I can't remember it!) who told about every detail of what we were eating. Said the portions were small but by the third course we were both starting to get pretty full (they aren't that small at all, really). Squash soup with duck confit was amazing, albeit rich. Sea Bass was excellent (my husband was practically licking his plate); the venison chop was very tasty but even tastier was the oatmeal cake underneath it! What was IN that thing? Had two different desserts - the passion fruit sorbet (heaven in your mouth!) and the apple strudel (couldn't eat it - too full - but saved it for later - looks delicious!) All of this with an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains. Didn't think we'd be lucky enough to get a table with such a beautiful view but somehow (w/ OpenTable.com) our request was honored, even though it was a packed house. May have been the best meal I've ever had! Whole bill, including two glasses of wine, a drink, and a $24 photo we ordered on the side, was around $300 so not cheap, but definitely a meal that created a memory.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

From the moment the lift door opened at the kitchen entrance we received 5 star treatment. I had requested a window table overlooking the Bellagio fountains which we received. The food was superb I had the Beef Wellington for main course which was excellent but looking at the table next to us someone had ordered a rack of lamb which looked amazing (defiantly going to order on my next visit.} Another important factor of the evening was the service. The waiter was always friendly and informative when offering advice on the menu and wine list . For desert I had the soufflé which is a house special it was light and a sooo chocolatey!!! To sum up the evening a special meal in a fantastic setting with superb service. A night we will never forget.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We were seated within 15 minutes at one of the nicest tables in the restaurant, at the window overlooking the Bellagio fountains. Our waiter, Shawn, was one of the nicest waiters we have ever encountered. He recommended the tasters menu, and we agreed it would be nice to try. We were not disappointed, it was exquisite.

I usually stay at Bellagio ....and look right across the fountains to Paris!!This time....at the suggestion of my Concierge, I booked a Special Dinner there!!We arrived to a special podium inside Paris , and were invited to board the special elevator to the restaurant. Much the same feeling as the original....the amber lights reflecting on the bronze superstructure... and then Voila', we arrived at the restaurant. The elevator arrives to an area inside the kitchen!! Quite a spectacular arrival.... Once inside the dining area...WOW, you are immersed in the gorgeous view of Las Vegas!!We had requested a Special Table along the windows closest to the Bellagio Fountains.We were not disappointed.... The view is breathtaking !! Just as we sat down, the fountains exploded with light and water..... The interior is kept quite dark, so as to showcase the incredible lights of the Las Vegas Strip! Our waiter and Sommelier were wonderful, and made us feel very special! I had read on TA., about the experiences of others, and decided to try some reviewer favorites....The wine list is extensive, and contains some wonderful selections from France.... Imagine? Our Sommelier suggested a lovely Bordeaux ...... Amazing!!We began with the warm foie gras....and the wonderful squash soup.... Both were perfect! Our waiter suggested/insisted that we try the Rack of Lamb.... with a few small sides of au gratin potatoes, and green beans. As we sat enjoying the gr8 wine, and appetizers....we were entertained by the fountain show across the street.... Breathtaking! Unlike so many Vegas eateries that are noisy and bustling.... Eiffel Tower is quiet and subdued, and calming!!The entrees arrived together, and were served with a flair..... The Rack of Lamb was outstanding, cooked perfect, and a large portion.....the sides were delicate, but adequate, and wonderful... Even the bread was perfect....We were treated to an incredible Raspberry Napolean , for dessert ...and our server surprised us with a complimentary selection of petite sweets..... As the fountains danced in the night....we finished our wonderful experience at Eiffel Tower. Absolutely a must DO, while in Vegas!! Expensive, but not any more than most of the gr8 Vegas Eateries....and the "Experience"....is Priceless!!!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The restaurant overlooks the fountain display across the street at the Bellagio so we were treated to several of the water shows. The food is quite good and quite expensive and like most "fancy" restaurants not that plentiful, so if you are really hungry and don't expect to pay out the nose for atmosphere go somewhere else.

THIRD- are you understanding to conventional menu somewhat mixed up a little, the steak pre sliced ect. Its not your conventional food but its good, my girlfriend says its great. I say somewhere in the middle of good and great. If this is for you then book your reservation and request a Window Table!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Lets start with the view. The tower is a half size repplica of the one in France. The resturant sits 11 stories up the tower. So the view puts you at eye level with the other surrounding hotels. But the best view is the water show accross the street at the Belaggio hotel every 30 min.Lights, lights, and more lights for the eye to see.Now the eating experience. Wonderful Flavors of appitizzors, I recomend the punch bowl of seafood. It can easly feed 4 people. Main courses include steaks,seafood, lamb, chateaubriand, Chicken, ETC. I had the ribeye it was the best I have ever ate. And desert if you can loosen your belt, Chocolate mouse is the best.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Well, the Eiffel Tower Restaurant at the Paris Hotel in Las Vegas appears to be mimicking the real Paris France experience when it comes to food and prices. Yes, the food and wine are excellent, but the average appetizer is $18 to $25, the average entree is $45 to $65, and that does NOT include a single side dish, which you will definitely want because the portions are indeed very small. Side dishes are $10 each and of coarse, they are definitely "single serving" in size. Don't even ask about the cost of wine. Suffice it to say that a single glass of wine is $18 to $30 and bottles easily range into the hundreds.I have been to some truly outstanding restaurants over the years, and this one is definitely up there, but I have had better experiences and better food for less money. If you decide to go here, you will need reservations and dress is, as expected, semi-formal to formal. You would be comfortable here in a jacket and tie, but since it is located in a casino on the Strip, you would also be fine in dress pants and nice shirt. The view is outstanding, located directly across the street from the Bellaggio and the Cosmopolitan. All in all, if you want a nice dining experience, I would recommend this restaurant, but be prepared to drop no less than $200 to $300 for a couple. Although very good, I have had better French dining experiences for as little as $100 a couple (try the Stella Mare in Santa Barbara CA as one example).</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The view of the strip (Bellagio Water Show) is fantastic. The food is elegant French. You take an elevator up to the restaurant. When the doors open, you are IN the kitchen. Pretty cool. The wait staff was excellent. Food is very french and very tasty. I had the Venison (ample portions). Cooked nicely and full of flavor. They have a great wine list. A really nice place to go for a "special" dinner. We had a large party and the service was totally acceptable.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Lunch is perfect time to try some of the tasteful dishes and get a feel for return visits. The evening is bit more pricy but the food is just as elegant and the views have more of a romantic flare.Been to Paris and found the food to be just as good and in some cases better. Highly recommend this restaurant to those who can afford it.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The morning of our dinner reservation, I stopped by the kiosk to confirm our reservation. The two ladies attending the kiosk were so helpful and genuine in their conversation with us. Upon arrival, the gentleman greeted us and sent us up onto the elevator to our destination where Keith, one of the bartenders made me one of the best Bombay Sapphire martini's I've ever had. ( I knew it was going to be a good night right then!) David waited on us the entire evening with the skill of a veteran, never overbearing, but there at our side whenever we needed anything-without having to ask! As we were celebrating a 40th birthday that evening, it was a true pleasure to have been seated by the windows to observe the water show from the Bellagio across the street. The food was phenomenal, filled with flavor and you just knew it was prepared with every detail in check! A final suprise came with our desserts...David brought us a special dessert with the words 'Happy Birthday' written in chocolate around the rim of the plate. Everything was just exquisite and they accomodated every request which made for a perfect evening. Thank you Paris and all of your staff!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

They were yelling, singing songs, and not appropriate for this type of restaurant, and the fact that no one from mgt tried to handle the situation, was very disspointing. We sat near several parties of two that came here for a romantic dinner and all the tables near us were visibly upset as well; one actually left after about an hour. When I told the waitress how disspointed I was, she sent over a manger who apologized, but offered nothing other than if I travel back to vegas again to send him a note. I go to vegas every 10 years or so, so this was his way to not offer anything for ruining our night. I still go back to the fact that i did not see anyone address this party while they were hooting it up, and that to me is disrespectable to all the other guests who were trying to have a nice night out. If you want a view, it can work, but don't expect the ambience of a fine restaurant, and honestly you can probably spend about $200 less at another restaurant, and be able to have a conversation at your table and hear each other!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

From the moment I read the guide books I knew that the Eiffel Tower Restaurant was the place to go. I booked my table through Lyle the Manager who was very helpful with my request for a fountain view and suggested the best times for the best views throughout the evening.From the moment you step foot into the private elevator you feel special. We welcomed at the top and had a short wait for our table. As promised we had a table overlooking the strip with the Paris Balloon on one side and the Bellagio Fountains on the other.We were introduced to Jorge our server who gave us the utmost attention for the whole night.As it was a special occasion we decided we’d splash out and have a bottle of Champagne. The Wine List is extensive with a good selection of all kinds of wines with prices to suit all pockets.The Courses were well spread out with plenty of time to digest and take in the view before the next course came. I had the Marinated Quail and the Rack of Lamb which were both cooked to perfection. My GF had the marinated raw beef and the Beef Wellington which were again excellent.As we were ordering Jorge informed us that they had an array of soufflés on the menu for desert, having never had one before I decided on the Caramel Soufflé and I’m really glad that I did. We also got a complimentary desert of chocolate mouse wishing my girlfriend a happy birthdayLyle came over during the evening to introduce himself and make sure everything was as we wanted. We also had our photograph taken as a memento of the evening.I can’t praise the restaurant and staff enough in particular Jorge our server and Lyle the Manager, I’d thoroughly recommend this to anyone looking for a special meal in Las Vegas and would definitely go back next time I’m in town.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We were there in May 2011 and we left thinking that the service, atmosphere and food couldn't be equaled at any restaurant. We were wrong, we returned in October 2011, with another couple and somehow Maria (our waitperson) and the rest of the staff exceeded all of our expectations and the memories we had from the last visit. The other couple was equally impressed and commented that from now on they would always visit the restaurant for a meal on any trip to Las Vegas. Lyle's personal attention to making sure we were happy and the entire evening went well only made the evening even more unbelievable. In May, I thought the experience was a dream, but not sure what word describes an event that beats the 'dream' hands down.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Our hotel - the Aria - made the reservation. I contacted them seperately to ask for a table with a view and that it was 2 Anniversaries. We arrived a little early and had drinks at the bar. A shame you cannot transfer you bar bill to the table. We were seated at a lovely booth for 4 overlooking the fountains opposite. I will not recount every detail but let me just say the service, the food, our waiter - everything was just perfect. we weren't rushed, we laughed, the banter with the staff was excellent, the beef wellinginton was sublime. And we were treated to desserts as our Anniversaries. We were exceptionally well loooked after. I would certainly go back on another visit to LV.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We were greeted outside of an elevator and led to a full service bar as we waited for the rest of our party. Once everyone was present, we were taken to a table for eight, next to a window overlooking the entrance to the hotel.The service was excellent, with four servers tending to our every need. We shared several appetizers, all were excellent. The entrees were too good to describe, but, even more, the side dishes were of a quality I have never had. The restaurant is a bit pricey, with a very pricy wine list, (nothing under $80), but it was the meal of a lifetime. Highly recommended.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

They took us a few minutes early.We were finally seated and had a cozy table with an excellent fountain view at the window. Decided to do the Chef's tasting menu. Very small plates/portions but ended up getting filled up. Most outstanding thing on the tasting menu was the chocolate souffle....With a bottle of wine (one of the least expensive bottles...) our bill was $340 for 2 of us....view was great but I think in the future I'd just stop in for an overpriced drink and call it good. The fountains are pretty but its not as nice as standing in front of them because you can't hear the accompanying music.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We had a booth table for 3 - very comortable. Lighting, temperature and noise levels were all very comfortable.Menu is modern French with a few classics. I tried the Chicken Consomme and Rabbit. The consomme was superb, light and tasty as it should be. The rabbit was the only disappointment - part of it was some formed reconstituted meat - like a mcnugget - but there was some genuine rabbit meat as well - bit disappointing. All the other food was excellent. The Grand Marnier souffle was too eggy but still good. Wine list is superb - had a very good value Malbec from the Loire - unusual to see in the USA.Service was unobtrusive, polite and available - excellent all round.Having eaten in the Eiffel Tower in Paris this year we expected much less than we got - an enjoyable experience that was well executed - give me a real rabbit casserole and it would have been perfect - but still worth it.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Why on earth would you go to a Frech restaurant with a world class French chef and order surf and turf? You can get that at Outback Steakhouse. Want lobster? Order the Warm Maine Lobster, Michigan Creamy Corn, Smoked Bacon appitizer. It's large enough to be an entree, and it's out of this world.Want steak? Order the Individual Eiffel Tower Beef Wellington, Sautéed Snap Peas. You won't find that at Outback. Like poultry? Order the Red Wine Marinated Quail, Chorizo Brioche Pudding, Swiss Chard, Petite Frisee. Just amazing.You can spend a king's ransom on wine, or simply pair the courses by the glass. Our table faced the Bellagio and was just fantastic. The service was outstanding. Our soufle's had to be done over but it wasn't a real problem. the server brought us a complementary specialty coffe and a tasting platter of sorbets.The only negatives I have are the seating which is a little tight (but it was Saturday night) and it was a little loud (but it is Vegas). My wife and I celebrated 25 years together and having dined well from Austrailia to Europe (including Jules Verne), we were very happy that we chose the Eiffel Tower restaurant. We had no idea that Chef Jean Joho started his training at L'Auberge de L'lll our favorite restaurant in France, and that he also is the chef at Everest, our favorite restaurant in Chicago.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

I had won a contest on a social network page to attend a souffle tasting and also decided to have dinner there afterward.Lyle Tolhurst, and the chef, and the entire staff were very pleasant and accommodating to our group for the tasting. The chef answered any and all questions that we had. The souffles themselves, we got to try banana, chocolate, caramel, pistachio, Grand Marnier, and strawberry (along with their sauces) were just indescribably delicious.After the tasting, my friend and I had dinner at a lovely table by the window with an incredible view of the Vegas lights and the Bellagio Fountains. The amuse was a cold corn soup that I would happily eat a gallon of. I had the Black Cod which was perfectly cooked and moist and delicious. My friend had the steak which I tried also and it was one of the best tasting steaks I have ever had, tender, juicy and cooked perfectly. We shared 2 sides, the Potato Anna gallette and the spinach. Both were very delicious. My friend remarked at the end of our trip that the spinach there may have been the best single thing she ate while in Vegas. We were too full for dessert (since we had tasted all the souffles before dinner then had dinner as well), but Lyle sent over some sorbets/gellatos for tasting and that was a perfect end to the dinner.I would not hesitate to recommend this restaurant for anyone who would like a truly memorable dinner and experience. The view is incredible, the food delicious, the staff friendly and attentive, and the entire experience.....incredible!!!I think it has now become a must for us for every trip!!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We were not disappointed.Early in the day, I stopped at the restaurant hoping to arrange for a special birthday desert. I spoke with restaurant supervisor Lyle Tolhurst, who couldn't have been more helpful and accommodating. He arranged for a lovely banana souffle with a lovely, hand-written "happy birthday" message on the plate, as well as an assortment of fresh berries. He also reserved us a table with a perfect view of the Bellagio fountains. Although I attempted to tip Mr. Tolhurst, he refused, saying, "It's simply hospitality, and that is my job." It was a true pleasure to encounter such gracious service.Later that evening, when we arrived, my husband was pleased and touched at the lovely table and view. The atmosphere was beautiful. Although the restaurant was quite busy, with a couple of larger wedding parties seated nearby, our table felt quiet, intimate and serene. Unfortunately, we both were feeling a bit under the weather and didn't have much of an appetite, so we didn't feel up to cocktails or wine, and we also skipped the appetizers and soup or salad. I really wish we'd been feeling better, as the menu offered so many items that we'd have loved to try.My husband ordered an entree of braised beef short ribs over noodles, which was very tender and flavorful. I had a duck breast entree, which was very good as well, if perhaps a tiny bit tough.Our waiter was gracious and attentive. He seemed a little bit unsure of himself and the menu, and we wondered if perhaps he was new at this job. At one point he came to present us the dessert menu and to ask if we wanted a souffle, in which case the kitchen would need advance time to prepare. This did sort of ruin the surprise of dessert for my husband, as I had to say to the waiter, "Could you please check up front, as I've made arrangements in advance." No real harm done. It was a mistake borne of good intentions, anyway.My husband was very pleased with his birthday desert. The souffle was light and scrumptious, and he said he'd never tasted raspberries so sweet. We couldn't have asked for a nicer evening. The sun set as we enjoyed the souffle and berries with a view of the spectacular Bellagio fountains. We headed off to our 8 PM show thoroughly satisfied with my husband's special celebration dinner.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

OUt of the 5 dishes, 2 were great, 2 were good, 1 was odd. This is not a cheap restaurant, our bill was almost $400 for 2 people, we expected that. I wish the service would have been better, and more attention to detail. We were served bread upon being seated, the bread was cold. I don't mean room temp,I mean out of refrigerator COLD! $400 for a meal and you dont have a bread warmer! Come on! Our waiter was OK. , just not real friendly. My suggestion would be to there for cocktails ( try the Eiffel Affair, the best cocktail I've had in years) and enjoy the view that way</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We had made reservations for 7pm but unfortunately ran very late, got there around 7:30. We were attending a show at 9 and didn't want to feel rushed for dinner so we went to tell the mait'r d to take us off the list. Jennifer, who I believe is a manager, was who we talked to and she convinced us to stay and assured us we could still enjoy dinner. She got us seated promptly and worked with the chefs and our server to ensure we would get done on time. Our meal was superb!!! Our server gave us great, prompt attention, and we never felt rushed. The food was delectable. I had veal, paired with a tantalizing pinot noir, and my husband had the monk lionfish. I can't use enough pretty words to describe how great our experience and food was. They even gave us a free desert since we were just married- very nice touch.The restaurant is pricey, of course, but it is worth every penny and then some! I can't wait to go back!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Our waitress was very accommodating. She made us feel important, and appreciated our patronage. Everything was wonderful, from the pear martini, the appetizers, the bread, the entrees (the salmon is quite possibly the best I've ever had), to the chocolate plate for dessert.

We've been here two years in a row and both times were fabulous. If you visit the Paris Hotel's site - you can see a virtual tour of the restaurant. We went in the evening - just about sunset - and were treated to the fountain show at the Bellagio (across the street) and to the sight of the sun setting and lights of the city coming on. Wow! I ordered the Beef Wellington and my husband had the surf and turf - both were fabulous. Note that the menu changes and if you want to check it out before you go - see the website. You need a reservation - so don't forget. And if you like chocolate - order the Godiva Chocolate Martini - mmmm. (And I'm not a big drinker so that says something.) Make sure this is on your list of places to see while in Vegas and don't forget your camera!

The service was excellent and the food was delicious. We chose to dine during brunch since we had children in our party, but would highly recommend the restaurant for a romantic dinner without children as well. The view of the Bellagio fountains are wonderful. We were seated at a window table and were able to enjoy the fountains throughout our meal. The eggs benedict were perfectly done and my grandmother stated that the chicken sandwich is one of the best she has had in her life. The blue cheese souffle was rich and creamy and the coffee was brewed perfectly. The apple cinnamon dessert was fantastic. I can't wait to dine here again in a more intimate setting with just my husband, a bottle of wine and a delicious meal.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

To date myself, I when to grad school at Northwestern U. when "Fritz, That's It" had the dream salad bar.So, a number of years ago, on one of our frequent trips to Las Vegas (we are the nervous owners of a condo-hotel unit there), we excitedly went to our first dinner at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant. It was basically a disaster - the food was so-so, expensive, and the service was horrible. We were largely ignored, due to some important dude's large party.Still having faith in LEY, we tried again a year ago (in July), for my husband's birthday. I noted our earlier disaster when making the reservations. That time, the meal was fantastic, and the service impeccable.Our most recent visit was on August 20, to celebrate our anniversary. Entry to the restaurant is through an exclusive elevator, which opens in the busy, but organized, kitchen. Located on the 11th floor, it's a compact, dark space, that overlooks the fountains of the Bellaigio Hotel (thank you, Steve Wynn). Ask for a window table, though the booths are very comfortable. We chose the Tasting Menu, along with the wine pairing. It's quite expensive (but it was a special occasion), but if you can swing it ($400 or so for a couple), do it! The chef put together a memorable meal, along with memorable wines. And the service is extremely profession, yet friendly. A wonderful experience.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The menu is not extravagant neither are the prices (I was suprised of both!) I had a filet mignon, a gratin dauphinois and for desert a meringue with champagne and mango. It was simply delicious: the meat was perfectly cooked, perfectly spiced and the size of it was good; as for the gratin, the gratin was delicious as well and the desert was just perfect: refreshing, sweet but not too much. One recommandation though: You do want to sit in front of the glaces so you can enjoy the romantic view and show during diner and so you have to arm yourself with patience because you'll usually have to wait a lot of time before you get your table. (app. 40 minutes.)--&gt;totally wirth it though!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

After reading several reviews on Trip Advisor, I decided to email the restaurant Supervisor (Lyle Tolhurst) to request a window seat with a nice view of the Bellagio fountains. Upon arrival, we were greated by the hostess who congratulated us on our anniversary. We were then promptly seated at the corner table which in my opinion, is the best seat in the house. The table was beautifully decorated with rose pedals and as I looked around, I noticed it was the only table decorated like this (very nice touch).I ordered the New York steak and my wife had the fillet. They were both cooked to perfection and we agree that they were two of the best steaks we have eaten. At the end of our meal, our waiter brought us a complimentary chocolate mousse with "Happy 10th Anniversary" written on the plate with drizzled chocolate. The staff did a great job of being very attentive without hovering around our table. Lyle even came to our table to introduce himself and to ensure that everything was to our satisfaction. This is one restaurant that knows the meaning of great service.If you are in Las Vegas and were only going out to dinner once, I would high recommend the Eiffel Tower Restaurant.Lyle, thank you again for not only meeting my expectations, but surpassing them.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Our service was outstanding, very quick but not overwhelmingly so. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary we splurged on a glass of wine that is the same price as a bottle yikes! had appetizers main and dessert. For the appetizers we both got different salads, I had a the crab and my hubby had the tomato salad both were good, not the most amazing but good. For main I ordered the duck breast and hubby had beef wellington. We choose not to get sides as we wanted dessert and his came with vegetables and mine with rice. My duck was awful, I have had duck multiple times and this was extremely tough and chewy I was very disappointed and was contemplating sending it back as it was a $36 duck breast... however the waiter was on his toes and noticed from a far that I was not happy with my meal and came up and asked what was wrong and offered to bring me something else, he even pointed out meals that would not take very long as husband was already eating and very much enjoying his beef wellington so I decided to get the filet mignon. It came out quick was just a piece of meat but was very tasty. I was disappointed as you can get steak anywhere and was looking forward to something different.After dinner they brought out a plate that had 'happy anniversary' written in chocolate and a sampler of amazing amazing chocolate mousse. We pre ordered a chocolate souffle and added a creme brulee.... words cannot even describe how happy my mouth was... the best best dessert I have ever had. And HUGE portions.... because of my unsatisfyed duck issue they paid for our souffle. The service was good, the food was good, dessert was out of this world, service was good and in certain spots awesome view. I did feel the prices were higher than needed. I have been to many fine dining restaurants and this was by far the most unreasonable.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The manager stopped by to wish us a happy anniversary and thank us for choosing, out of all the restaurants we could have gone to, the Eiffel Tower. In this day and age, that level of customer service just blew us away. The waiter was very accommodating and very knowledgeable about the wine list. The chef sent over a special little anniversary sweet before the most amazing chocolate souffle came out. If you go to this restaurant, no matter how full from dinner you are, you HAVE to get the chocolate souffle. Has to be one of the best things I ever ate in my whole life!

Luckily he likes salty food because I took one bite and almost gagged it was so salty. I could never have eaten it personally. Waitress boasted of best souffle's in the world..well, overstated, but I had the lemon and it was very good. Service was excellent but tables next to the glass as so close and cramped, I kept bumping into the poor guy next to me.

We asked our waiter to be moved and he said we would have to go back to the hostess stand without any inquiry himself. We then waited 30 more minutes at the bar (and had a very nice bartender)....when we finally got a table we waited for half an hour and only had a few pieces of bread! The waiter then took our order for appetizers and our main course. We got our appetizer half an hour later. It was around 9:30 pm when we decided to just ask for the bill and leave. The waiter wondered why we were leaving before our main course...He seemed surprised that we wouldn't wait 2 hours for our meal!! There were no apologies and seemingly no care from management.

Also, we did not have reservations on a busy Sunday night, and we were seated right away.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The females at the front desk could have put on a smile and acknowledges our arrival instead of talking to each other before sorting us out, another thing would be they have the bus tables set throughout the restaurant literally 2mrters from our table it was very loud and not very astheticly pleasing.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

I was fortunate to have enough Amex rewards points to order a $200 gift card for LYE restaurants prior to coming. Because I had “friended” the Eiffel Tower on face book, I had seen the manager mention that you should email him for a reservation. I did just that about a month before. I told him we would be celebrating a special anniversary and hoped we could get a table at the window. We arrived at the elevator at our reservation time of 6:30. (We had 9:30 tickets for Jersey Boys). We were taken up and I immediately asked the hostess for Lyle Tolhurst, the manager I had emailed. He greeted us warmly and took us to the best table in the house, in the corner facing the fountains. The table was covered in rose petals. (the only table decorated like that). I was so taken by this wonderful table and treatment I tried to tip Lyle for taking care of us. He put the money back in my hand and said, this is just the service we provide. I almost fell off my chair.We ordered the Blue Cheese Soufflé Pudding, Olive Oil Poached Halibut for my wife, Sautéed Veal Medallions’ for me and a side of mushroom spaetzle. We also ordered a Chocolate Soufflé for desert. We were immediately brought a basket of fresh baked bread and butter and an amuse bousche. The amuse was a trifecta of bites of heaven. I can’t remember what they were, only that they were delicious. Our main courses were fantastically luscious. The spaetzle was amazing. During the entire meal we were treated to the Bellagio Fountains show. After the main course they brought the delicious soufflé. Then they brought us a complementary little espresso glass filled with a chocolate mousse. After that, they brought a tray of profiteroles complements of the chef. It was an amazingly perfect dinner. One note. This is one of the few places that holds to its dress code; Collars and nice slacks for men. One guy came in a t-shirt and they gave him something else to wear. This is unlike Fluer that said they had a dress code but had people eating in shorts.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We did have lunch and my expectations were very high. Ive read so much about this restaurant that I expected it to be my favorite french restaurant. We had an amuse bouche of Asparagus Flan. Absolutely spectacular. My hubby got the steak sandwich (which was also excellent, I wished I would have ordered the same) I got the crab french toast which was where the meal went wrong. The toast was stuffed with a very heavy mixture of crab and mayonaise. The bread was very heavy, greasy and in conjunction with the crab mixture it just wasn't at all what I expected or very palate pleasing. Then we ordered dessert which was the apple strudel and it wasn't a bad dessert but it wasn't what you would expect from a restaurant with this kind of stellar reputation. Our server was excellent but the experience was inconsistent. The distance between the highs and the lows were too great for me to give the review I had been hoping to give.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We came here for lunch, our reservation was for 14:30 which was more or less that last slot for lunch service. The service is 100% fantastic. The waiter was very softly spoken and was very good at making suggestions. I went for the steak and the waiter informed me that the particular steak was over $25 dollars more expensive in the dinner menu so i was right to go for lunch!The meal was 3 course, had some lovely onion soup, the waiter provided us with a small tub of asparagus and cream - dont know the exact name but tastes brilliant!.When serving wine, they bring the glass and a small glass bottles which contained one measurement of wine which was very posh (im not posh so i felt very royal!)When we booked our reservation the night before downstairs at the eiffel tower casino, the gentlemen simply took our names and our desired time and gave us a card. We mentioned that we were vacationing the States for our honeymoon so when we were contemplating desserts, the waiter surprised us with a lovely ice cream dessert with chocolate engraved 'Happy Birthday' but was promptly replaced with Happy Honeymoon.The waiter also happily took our camera and took pictures of me and my wife and looked at his watch and asked us to look outside and saw the Bellagio water fountain display - viewing it from the top of the restaurant is the best!All in all, lovely food, great environment and very nice staff. Excellent!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We were seated at the second best table there (the first one was already taken), and we got to enjoy the day view of the bellagio and their fountains. The food was faaantastic!! The desert (creme brulee) was out of this world..The only thing I felt a little bit out of place, maybe because of too much attention (yes that exists), or maybe it was our waiter (a snobby young man).

Everything about this restaurant, the food, service, view really is first class but it was the small personal touches provided by Lyle that set it apart from anywhere else we dined at in Vegas. Some people have complained about the prices but the menus are all on line so you know exactly what sort of cost your evening is going to be before you go.

We were having a frustrating morning of site seeing. A long week of vacationing in multiple locales was finally taking its toll on us. Spotting the Eiffel Tower after exiting the Bellagio, we said "If they have a restaurant, let's go to the Eiffel Tower for lunch. We never got to do that in France." We usually try to consider TripAdvisor and friends’ recommendations. This time we just lucked out!Arriving in nice shorts and t-shirts, we inquired if we were dressed acceptably. At lunch time, this was not an issue; the atmosphere was classy and casual at the same time. We were cheerfully welcomed and seated by a window overlooking Caesars Palace and Bellagio with good views of The Strip and the Bellagio lagoon.For starters, our friendly waiter brought out a complimentary taste of thick mushroom soup and some yummy puffed treats. For lunch I had the Chicken Paillard and my other half had the Aged Parmesan Crusted Chicken. Both dishes were delicious and came with starches and vegetables. To say these were excellent would be an understatement.While the hotel and restaurant were Las Vegas' rendition of Paris, the meal couldn't have been more French or delicious. The environment and service were excellent. The prices, for all we enjoyed, were especially reasonable. I highly recommend the Eiffel Tower Restaurant and look forward to a return visit next time I am in Las Vegas.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We could see the fountains at the Bellagio which went off every half hour; City Centre was to the left (lots of glass and lights!).Food was very Frenchy. My wife and I loved our entrees. My son, could only have a salad which was also probably the best salad I have had in a while. And then desert: Napolean and Creme Brulee. Nice way to end a fine meal. (Wine was supreme.

We had made a reservation for the Eiffel Tower Restaurant several months in advance after noticing on their website that they were recommended. I had gotten some mixed reviews from some people who had eaten there so we weren't quite sure what we had in store.Our reservation was for 8:30 PM and when we arrived about 15 minutes early, I asked the hostess if it would be possible to get a table by the front window which overlooks the beautiful Bellagio Fountains. I mentioned it was our honeymoon and she said it may take a bit more time than our reservation time but she'd do her best.We ventured to the bar and ordered a couple drinks. Let me preface this by saying we knew this night would probably be on the pricey side, which was totally OK and it started here at the bar. My wife ordered a Cosmopolitan and I got a Gin and Tonic. Cost for two drinks? $28 Now I'm not cheap but needless to say, we savored these drinks until the hostess approached us and very politely said our table was ready.We followed her to the absolutely best table in the house! Directly in front of the Bellagio Fountains and an unbelievable view of the strip. Vegas at night is amazing and the view from our table was outstanding.The waiter was very pleasant and very attentive. The menu is a mix of classic french entrees, seafood and steak. All items are a la carte. I ordered the fillet minion ($49) and my wife ordered the sirloin steak with some sort of reduced wine sauce ($49). We each ordered a side of potatoes ($9 per side). The meal was accompnied by another server which offered us several fresh breads to chose from and a huge patty of creamy butter.The meal was absolutely delicious. Both of our steaks were done to perfection. Honestly, I've never had a better fillet. My wife's steak was fantastic and I asked the waiter what the sauce was and again he was very polite and explained exacly what the chef had done to create it.Before we had ordered our dinner, the waiter had asked us if we wanted to order the souffle for dessert since it took 45 minutes to prepare. We ordered it and when it arrived, he poured a small cup of molten chocolate directly into the center. My wife loves chocolate, so she was in heaven. Again, delicious.The waiter also came back with a small cup of chocolate mousse and two little spoons. There was a piece of chocolate with the words "best wishes" or "happiness" (I can't recall) written in French placed on top. We were told it was compliments of the chef in celebration of our honeymoon. Very nice touch indeed.So the entire evening (with tip) was around $250 but it was the highlight of our stay in Las Vegas. We saw the fountains go off numerous times, took a ton of pictures and were treated with the utmost in personalized service. A really romantic way to spend the evening.Highly recommended.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Your significant other will appreciate it especially if they are wearing heels.We were a few minutes late for our reservation, which wasn't a problem and they had our table waiting for us. I did email Lyle, the restaurant has a facebook page, to mention it was our 10th anniversary.Waiter was very good and attentive, without being overbearing. One thing I did notice when we sat down the red plates had a significant amount of dust on it, enough that I was able to see it and comment to my wife about it. Just a minor detail.All food was well seasoned and cooked as requested. We shared and escargot, both had lamb and shared sides of potatoes and a spinach mushroom dish. We ordered a chocolate and pistachio souffle as well, both were good. I would recommend the chocolate over the pistachio, they were both warm, light and fluffy. We were also treated to a little anniversary dessert, another nice touch which wasn't expected. We were very full and satisfied by the end of the meal.Lyle was great and I noticed he was very professional and took the time to talk to every table in the restaurant. This is a nice touch and makes every table feel special. Little things like this make you want to return again.

Thereafter, we were going to dine at the Eiffel Tower. We called a week prior to let them know and asked to be placed by the window. When we arrived they did not have any notes about our special day nor the sitting. So we got setting away from the window. Strike one. The wait staff was very slow to get to us. We had to flag someone down. It took 20 minutes to get our drink orders and another 20 to get our dinner orders. The food was only so-so, but for the roasted chicken, which was very good. The meal was very expensive and not at all worth what we paid for. It was also very loud and we could not hear oursevels without yelling. Very disappointed.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

I was impressed with so many things. The food was fabulous (the foie gras with cherries was so good I wished that I had ordered 4 servings of just that). Our group of four had fish, lamb, filet and steak, and every bite was great. The sides we ordered were just the right amount. We shared Potatoes Anna and creamed spinach and mushrooms, both excellent. The dessert I shared was the chocolate plate, the best variety of completely scrumptious desserts I've ever had. The chocolate souffle was praised by those who ate that. The view from our window table was incredible, with the sun setting and then the lights of the Strip and the Bellagio fountains entertaining us every 15 minutes. But even better than both the food and view was the superb service. We were treated like queens by everyone. Lyle made us feel really special and our server, Ron, was attentive and fun, as was everyone we encountered at the restaurant. Every year when I go to Las Vegas I include one elegant dinner and from now on that will always be the Eiffel Tower Restaurant. Lyle promised to try to impress and he far exceeded my expectations. I can't praise this restaurant too much; don't miss it!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

(i.e indoor smoking, 24 hour ringing from the slot machines, and BRIGHT neon lights). On the same token, I'm also the type of person that can find fun things to do or good eats in almost any place in the world, which leads me to this restaurant. We had a late lunch here and were lucky enough to get a table by the window to see the dancing water fountain at the Bellagio across the way. You could even hear the classical music from where we were sitting. It was almost like we were away from the dizziness of Sin City, except we were still there. I had the parmesan crusted chicken, which was just ok for the expensive price, but she had the classic hamburger that was almost amazing. (yes, "almost" because the bun was just ok, but the juiciness and the tenderness of the meat made up for it) We also shared the creme brulee which was mouth-washing deliciousness! All in all, it was a good experience for me and my date. Although this was one of those places where you go once in a while just to get away from the craziness.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We had a window table with amazing views of the Bellagio fountains. The food was delicious (we can definitely recommend the individual beef wellingtons - yum!) and plentiful. After reading some reviews on here we were expecting minute portions but this wasnt the case at all. The dessert of chocolate souffle was absolutely devine, I wish I was eating one right now. The wine menu was massive, we had a very nice californian red for about $140 but there was cheaper and much MUCH more expensive options if you wanted to splurge. The Eiffel Tower restaurant isnt cheap but this is a special place, go for a special occasion or to treat yourselves you won't be disappointed.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Lyle was wonderful at setting up the reservation, even though I changed my mind a couple of times. He assured me we would have a wonderful experience.  What a wonderful time we had! We were treated like VIPs…from the moment we walked in, until the last little crumb was eaten we were wowed! The rose petals on the table, the complimentary appetizers, and the surprise anniversary dessert was all amazing! The restaurant itself is beautiful with the whole front windowed facing the Bellagio fountains. It is high enough up that the view was spectacular. The fountain show was awesome from our window seats. Our waiter Ron was so good that he made sure we got what we wanted before we even knew we wanted it! My DH loved his char broiled filet mignon, and my roasted free range chicken was very good. We shared a Caesar salad as well as sides of asparagus and potato gratin. The asparagus melted in our mouths. After our beautiful surprise dessert Ron came by with a tray of chocolates. I chose one, then DH choose two, so I said it wasn’t fair, I wanted two as well..lol…! The price for this wonderful and romantic experience was only $180, and that is including a generous tip.I would definately recommend this restaurant for anyone who wants to have an evening of romance.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Excellent food, pricey yes, but well worth it. Great view of the fountains at the Bellagio also. We were treated with alot of dignity also, we were congradulated many times by different people working there for our 20 year achievement and we are a same sex couple, it did not make a bit of difference to anyone.

Haing visited Vegas on several occassionsand trying out many restaurants, we started looking at menus online and tried to decide where would suit us best!We'd never eaten at the Eiffel tower restaurant before, but after looking at menus we decided it seemed perfect for our special day. I originally tried to book using the online system but it wanted me to call up ad pay a deposit over the phone. As we were from the UK this was a bit of a problem and so I emailed the restaurant directly to see if they could help. The manager Lyle got back to me within a day saying that he'd reserved us a beautiful table for 8pm and that unless anything changed, just to turn up on the day.On the evening of our wedding we got a taxi to the Pari hotel and made our way to the Eiffel tower restaurant. It was really nice walking through the hotel in our wedding outfits as lots of people congratulated us etc. Once we got to the restaurant we were congratualted by the staff downstairs and taken up to the restaurant in a lift. Once in the restaurant we were asked if we wanted a drink at the bar first and so we went and had a glass of pre-dinner champagne. We were then shown to our table and as we were walking there we passed some tables in the window overlooking the Bellagio fountains and I was thinking to myself that it would be amazing if we could have one of those tables! Anyway the table we were shown to far exceeded our expextations! It was the corner table overlooking the fountains! It was decorated with rose petals and was just beautiful!Our somalier introduced himself and guided us through the extensive menu. He helped us pick out a bottle of red that was special to us because of where it was from. The wine is on the expensive side but for a special occassion and in such a wonderful setting, we didn't mind. Our waiter was wonderful and had just the right level of attentiveness without being intrusive. Firstly we were given an amuse bouche of asparagus mousse which was light and got the taste buds going! I had the cheese souffle to start and it was literally one of the best things I've ever tasted! I can't think what my husband ordered now, but he was equally impressed with watever it was! For my main course I had a vegetarian crepe which was wonderful but very filling and my husband ordered the beef wellington which was out of this world. We barely had room for dessert but orderd a caramel souffle to share, which was perfect. After we had finished that, the waiter bought out a chocolate mousse with congratulations on it, which wasa lovely touch.It is worth noting that when you first emerge from the lift you get to see the open kitchen, I think this is always agood sign! We truly did have the most wonderful meal we've ever had here and we've had many great meals in Vegas and throughout the world. At first we wondered whether we'd be paying for the setting and novelty and thought that the food might just be 'so so' as is the case with so many restaurants. But this couldn't be further from the truth. The food was probably the best we've ever eaten, the service impecciable and the ambience spot on.I cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough and we will definately be returning when we visit Vegas in March.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

So I called, and the response was "Is there anything else I can help you with?". Am I overly-sensitive, or is that simply rude? I had expected "Oh that's great, I'll note that in here" or at least some acknowledgement of what I had said. In reflection, I'm guessing the women I spoke to on the phone ended up being our maitre d' (more on her soon).We had booked on July 25th for 6:30pm, which was pretty perfect given that it meant we were early enough to get a seat by the windows, giving us an amazing view over the Bellagio fountains, with the sun setting behind the mountains in the distance. Unfortunately despite the fact that we arrived bang on time, we didn't get to sit down for quite a while. In fact the whole arrival process was confusing. Firstly we walked up to the elevator that says "Eiffel Tower Restaurant" and pressed the button, but it didn't respond. Eventually we discovered another elevator on the other side which was manned. We hopped in, but just as the doors were closing another party hopped in. When the doors opened, that group was warmly welcomed and taken off somewhere. We sort of just stood there, seemingly in the middle of the kitchen, not sure where we were going, with staff milling all about. Finally we worked out that the restaurant was around to the left, probably about where the first (unmanned/unavailable) elevator was. So maybe it was out of order? Anyway so the party ahead of us finally moved out of the way, I approach the maitre d', or I should say maitre d's, since there were 3 people standing there, none of which seemed to be able to help us. The "other two" pointed at the third one, who was typically vegas: young, female, bright dress, busty, busy, and not very interested in helping us :-o. In fact she ignored us completely, staring at her screen, which was ok for a while, but eventually I started to get annoyed at which point I said hello, and she literally "showed me the hand" for a little while, and then asked my name, without even looking up from the screen, so I guess it must have been quite a movie she had playing down there ;-). She then asked me to wait to the side, without any apology, no indication as to why our table wasn't ready (it was now about 6:40), and no indication as to how long it would be.So we stood to the side and chatted, which was fine, really, but after about 10 minutes of watching several other parties get seated instantly, my wife got sick of it and prodded me to go forward, which I did. Same drill - without looking up, she asks "Name?". Now - I don't know about you, but when I am the ONLY PARTY waiting for a table at a place where I am about to drop $800, then I expect the maitre d' to at least be aware of who we are and why we are waiting, but she apparently wasn't able to keep track of that. Upon being given our name, she said the table wasn't ready yet. No explanation as to why, or how long, and now I'm getting a bit upset, so I asked her if perhaps she could be so kind as to tell us how much longer it would be, given we had booked a table, and she said "They're just putting the silverware out now", which actually didn't answer my question, but at least it gave us an idea, and sure enough we were seated shortly afterwards, I guess around 7pm, half an hour after our booked time. At this point I'm ready to give the place 1 star, and honestly if we'd gotten a bad table at this point, we would have left, but happily our table is right by the windows with an AMAZING view, so I start to cheer up a lot.Our waiter was a very likeable fellow and the wine list was incredibly extensive, so I started to cheer up even more. We ordered some bubbly water. As others here have noted, you can expect wines at this restaurant to cost about 4x what they cost retail (+ tip = 5x), which is undeniably very expensive, on the other hand they are cellaring a massive range of bottles in the middle of Las Vegas. I was disappointed to see that they only had two Australian reds on the menu, neither of which I had ever heard of (and I'm a bit of an expert on Australian reds), but that was more or less expected, and they had enough American and French bottles in price ranges to satisfy pretty much anyone (at least anyone with enough money to book at this restaurant at all).They had a set menu with 6 small dishes for $98 + matching wines for $70 which was (as usual for such things) a great value compared to a la carte, and I would definitely have gone for that, however one in our party really didn't want to, and unfortunately the restaurant requires everyone at the table to order that menu, so it wasn't possible for us. We'd already polished off a bottle of Champagne in the room before we left, so we got straight into it. We ordered appetizers with a bottle of Chardonnay and mains with a bottle of red. I was asked to confirm the 4-digit numbers to the left of the wines, which is undoubtedly an efficient way to do it, however in the real Eiffel Tower I think the waiters would rather serve Fish and Chips than do it that way - it infers that the waiter doesn't really know the wine list, and reminded me of a Chinese restaurant - "Number 4 with chicken" ;-).We were asked by a pretty young lady whether we wanted out photos taken, which we declined. We were served bread by a very nice older woman. Although I personally thought my bread was really tough (definitely not freshly baked), the others seemed to like theirs, and mine was tasty enough.The waiter came with both the white and the reds, confirmed both bottles, and then opened the white and poured it for me to taste. After I indicated it was OK, he poured for everyone else, however he then did something I have never seen before in any restaurant - he immediately poured the red, and asked me to taste it. Personally, I don't really want to mix the white and red like that, however I guess it could be argued that it gives the red time to breathe. The red was OK, so he then poured it, too, and we now had both white and red glasses - a bit weird, but not really a problem.Our appetizers arrived. I had the crab salad, which really was excellent - I loved it, the sun was setting, and everyone seemed to like their food and we were having a great time.We were asked whether we wanted to order soufflé (which as everyone knows takes time and needs to be ordered in advance), which we did - we ordered two of them for the four of us, figuring we could order the other two deserts later.For the main I had tenderloin which I had ordered medium but to me it was medium-well, but maybe I'm just cursed since I had the same thing a couple of nights before and this time decided not to worry about it. We had each ordered sides, which was a mistake since 3 of us ordered the same side and they were huge and most of it ended up going back to the kitchen.At this point we were pretty tipsy, and I guess time just flew by, since seemingly out of nowhere, the soufflés arrived, were served with great flair, and then the guy serving them (not our waiter) disappeared into thin air. Now I found this quite annoying, since we had planned on ordering both dessert wine and a couple more desserts. Luckily our waiter turned up fairly quickly, and we ordered some desert wine however we decided not to wait around for more desserts since the soufflés looked pretty huge, none of us are big eaters, and we didn't want to wait around.I tip 25% for great service however on balance I thought the service was really not up to scratch and only left 15%, which still ended up adding up to $850, so that gives you an idea of the prices. I think the atmosphere here is hard to beat, however the service really needs to be better, especially the maitre d', who frankly shouldn't even be working at a TGI Friday's, let alone here.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

However, the food compared to the many French restaurants in the city, did nothing to impress me. I also did not feel too well after eating there. Perhaps it was not Meg Ryan's train scene from French Kiss, but my stomach was not happy. As far as service, I made reservations far in advance on July 4th, so that we could have a fantastic view of the fireworks. I was coaxed into changing my reservation as the person booking our table stated they were going to do fireworks on July 3rd this year 2010. And guess what? There were no fireworks that night of course! NO apologies were offered, and certainly no classy way of resolution was demonstrated. From the food to the service, this is more of a Paris wannabes kind of experience, unless you factor in the snob factor you hear about, yet no one speaks French or has anything to stick their nose in the air about as far as I can tell. If you want fine French food, I would try another route. If you just want a few drinks with a view in a romantic setting, this could work. Oh, and don't forget the proton pump inhibitors.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

I'd made reservations months in advance, and requested they put us at a table that would overlook the fountains at Bellagio, across the street.They did that, putting us at the second best table, in my opinion, in the restaurant: right next to the window, and only one seat from the corner table (the best seat, I think). THAT seat was taken up by a couple who were enjoying their first dinner together as husband and wife, still dressed in tux and wedding dress, so we didn't mind being down one table, at all.The service was outstanding, and the wine list was extensive (and expensive). In fact, the entire menu was $$$$, but we ate there expecting that. It's not every day you celebrate 20 years of wedded bliss, and I went all-out. It was certainly the most expensive meal I've ever eaten, but I'm not complaining.I had the Beef Wellington, which melted in my mouth, and my wife had the rabbit. Her's wasn't as good as mine, but was tasty. We had some side items to go with our meal, all of which were at least good, some better than others. We had two appetizers, because we couldn't decide which we wanted: warm duck foie gras or a salad with several exotic animal bits in it, including "sweetbreads" (brains). The duck liver was the better of the two, but we ate all of it :)We had a $65 bottle of wine to go with our meal, based on the recommendation of the staff, and were very happy with the choices they offered us. Dessert was a souffle that was extremely good, as well.The best part of the meal was the location and the service (and my Wellington), and we enjoyed a wonderful time with an exquisite view of the strip and the fountains across the street. I would certainly eat there again, but only for an equally special occasion.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The service is first class and the food is terrific. Of course this all comes at a price that is expected, but not outrageous. My wife and I each had a salad, an entree, we split dessert and each had a glass of wine and coffee. This cost with tip and tax, just over $200. The manager came over to introduce himself to us and asked if there was anything he could do for us to make our experience even better. His name was Lyle.

Well,,,,,, our table seemed to be the best in the house! directly overlooking the Bellagio fountain show, was amazing. You get out the elevator and walk straight into the kitchen where you are greeted which was a lovely touch. We arrived a little too early so had to sit at the bar and order a glass of wine whilst looking out over to the strip - no great hardship..! ;-)We were sat up there as day turned to night and it was beautiful. Dont agree with any of the comments about it being snobby, i am far from being a snob but if your going to a fine dining restaurant - make an effort!! simple!The food was beautiful and between our starter and main we had a complimentary cold soup served which was amazing - i could of eaten a whole bowl! Also, at the end of the meal my partner received a complimentary happy birthday dessert which was a wonderful touch.It wasnt cheap, but if you were paying just for the view you could complain, but as it had the best view and romantic atmosphere, topped with the amazing food and service it was worth every penny and highly reccomended for a special occassion ( we had a 26yr anniversary couple one side of us and newlywed bride and groom the other)</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The wine list is extensive but very expensive, too. There is a real air of snobbishness there. We have dined in very nice restaurants in the past, but we felt a little like we were being "forced" to chose an expensive wine or menu item as it was "highly recommended" (like a bottle of wine for over $1,000). Our server was knowledgeable but a bit pushy and had a "know it all" attitude about the food, wine, and just about everything else. We asked him to take some pictures for us and he even made adjustments to the settings on our camera because he apparently knew all about photography, too - but the pictures he took turned out blurry and are useless to us. Our better pictures are those we took ourselves. The view was beautiful and it was a nice place to dine, but I think the whole "Eiffel Tower" thing has gone to their heads - this isn't France, after all! And just because a couple decides to dine at the nice restaurant doesn't mean that money is no object.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We were celebrating our 1st wedding anniversary and wanted somewhere nice for dinner. I wish that when I made our reservation that they would have told me about the mandatory dress code. My husband had shorts on with a collared shirt and close toed sandals. They require long pants and socks. They way they treat you when you are not dressed correctly is kind of rude. It made us feel very out of place. Living in napa we are used to nice restaurants and have never been treated that way anywhere before. We ended up having to go back to the hotel so my husband could change and an $10 cab ride later, we arrived back at the restaurant. We also brought our own wine which in Napa is not frowned upon...we we were not allowed to bring it in with us.. they made us check it with them and pick it back up when we left. By the way..we had the wine with us the first time we showed up and nothing was said to us about it or we would have left it at our hotel when my husband had to go back to change. At this point I really felt like just saying we wanted to cancel our reservation, but was scared they would charge me since I had to hold the reservation with a credit card. They redeemed themselves a little when we were able to sit at a table facing the bellagio fountains. The waiter was extremely friendly. The food was very good but totally over priced. We got the blue cheese souffle, cream of artichoke soup to start. We both got beef wellington as an entree and we got a caramel souffle for dessert. They did also bring us a small dessert that said happy anniversary, that was nice. With a bottle of wine 2 appetizers, 2 entrees and a dessert, our bill was $500 after leaving a tip. Before we planned our trip to Vegas we contemplated just staying home and going to the French Laundry as ouur anniversary present. For how much we spent at Eiffel tower restaurant we could have.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The service was impeccable-Pierre was delightful and knew how to be professional without being stuffy. The wine list is over the top ridiculous--not a lot of French wine under $500 and many in four and five figures (!) That said, we chose a very nice St. Estephe that was more than we would normally pay, but didn't break the bank. Our dinner was spectacular, from the chilled asparagus cream soup amuse bouche, to the foie gras appetizer, the lamb and veal entrees, and the amazing chocolate souffle for dessert. There was also a small plate after dessert containing chocolates, fruit candy slices, almond cookies and caramels. This is a very, very expensive restaurant, but it was well worth the cost for an amazing experience. Job well done!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We had decided we would like to have dinner at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant and I had read some pretty good reviews. I made the booking through Open Table, months and months in advance, as this was our first time to Las Vegas and our anniversary, I didn’t want to leave it to chance that we could just turn up and get a table. I mentioned in the comments that it would be our anniversary and would love one of the window tables with a view of the fountains. From the moment you walk up to the elevator to head up the restaurant, the staff are welcoming and friendly. We were a little bit early so had a drink at the bar before being taken to our table. It was a great seat, a lovely half circle table right by the window, we were not directly in front of the Bellagio Fountains, just off to the side, but it gave us a great view down the strip and of the Paris Balloon. Our waiter was truly the best waiter we have ever had, he was polite, friendly, and knowledgeable. He welcomed us and wished us a happy anniversary straight away. The food was wonderful, best piece of Filet Mignon I have ever had, pretty much melted in your mouth. Before dessert our waiter brought out a lovely little anniversary treat for us! I had ordered a soufflé for my dessert - chocolate – the waiter brings it out and then pours warm chocolate sauce on it at the table. I was pretty good!! The waiter will also arrange your tickets if you are wanting to go up to the viewing part of the tower. All in all, it was an amazing meal and experience, I highly recommend it if you are wanting to have a special meal while in Las Vegas. Will definitely go back on out next trip to Las Vegas.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We usually chose to eat at other restaurants in Las Vegas, such as Mix, Il Mulino, Aureole to name a few. In the afternoon we took the elevator up to check out the restaurant and the menu and get the layout of the restaurant and were very pleasantly surprised on all counts. The day manager described the dishes very appealingly and enthusiastically (we are foodies!), the wine list looked very interesting and the view looked really good too. So we went back down the elevator and confirmed our reservation. Dinner that night was wonderful. Our server, Maria, was very professional, efficient, knowledgable, unobtrusive but helpful and friendly. The wine flowed, even the server bringing breads came at all the right times. Our meals were just delicious. We had rack of lamb that was cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly and duck breast that just melted in your mouth. The sides were very good also, we had a Luberon red wine that was very good (reasonably priced) and we ordered souffle for dessert that was just scrumptious. Lyle from Management stopped by our table and was so personable and welcoming, we felt like we'd always known him - it was a really nice touch. This is definitely our favorite restaurant in Las Vegas now because of the quality and service of the meal, the delicious food itself plus the view of the fountains at Bellagio. We know we will return here again.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We were so excited as it was our one year anniversary celebration. We had both spent a lot of time getting ready to go. We went to the lift and were escroted up with other guests. The hostess then escorted us and another group of people around the corner and handed my husband and another man the most vile dinner jackets I had ever seen and said they couldnt come in unless they put them on as they werent wearing shirts with a collar, they both looked smart but for some reason this wasnt good enough. My husband was agreeable to this although he wasnt happy and put it on and it was 2 sizes too big, they had no other sizes available and expected him to sit through the meal looking ridiculous. The other man had to go and buy a shirt from one of the shops in the hotel. I just thought the way we were treated was disgusting so just cancelled the reservation and left without so much as an apology for their mistake. Looking at the booking confirmation it says formal attire is recommended (not essential) and he was dressed smart, just not in a collared shirt as he is 22 after all. The whole thing was so disappointing, i wouldnt recommend this restaurant to anyone as the service was appauling.</review><polarity>-1</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

We decided it would be nice to go on a double date with the new couple on our last night in Las Vegas. Immediately upon entering the restaurant I was impressed with the views and the staff! While we weren't seated close to a window to see the Bellagio fountains, we still got great view of the hotels on the other side of the strip. I can't imagine what the view must have been like seated close to the windows!Right away our server (I wish I could remember his name!) greeted us and offered us a wine list while we looked over the menus. He asked what the occasion was and we told him it was our friends wedding. He was absolutely fantastic!! He answered any questions we had about the menu and kept a close eye on our drinks at all times. I never had to wait for my drink to be refilled. The wine list here is quite large (and marked up, but that was to be expected). My boyfriend and I both ordered the filet mignon with red wine sauce and it was perfect! There was not one problem with anything that was brought out to us. We also both ordered desserts and they were both better than what I was expecting (I believe the wedding couple had Crème Brulee and we had White Chocolate Banana Elysèe) and the happy new couple received a complimentary dessert from the chef congratulating them on their wedding. The whole atmosphere and dining experience were truly unforgettable. The wait staff did such an amazing job and made us feel welcome and comfortable. Yes, the whole meal was pricey, but we knew that when we were making the reservations. It was all well worth it.

It was cool being able to watch the fountains, but not as fun as we could not hear the music. I ordered the filet mignon. My husband ordered prime rib and lobster. We had to order veggies al a carte (green beans almondine and potatoes al gratin). We expected to be blown away, given that the prices are exorbitant. The filet tasted good, but nothing to write home about. The green beans were soggy (not crisp), the almondine sauce was runny. The potatoes au gratin was served in a small pan - so small that we barely could get a serving each AND they didn't taste that great, either. I was so disappointed.

It seemed appropriate to have a French meal with them since we first met them there. The Eiffel Tower restaurant gave us a meal to remember!We had reservations for 8:00pm and were escorted up to the restaurant in the private elevator inside the Paris casino. Even though it was a Monday night, the place was packed! Nevertheless, we were immediately shown to our table which had a good view of the Bellagio fountains even though the table itself was not right at the window. Immediately upon seating our server, David, came over and asked us if we wanted a cocktail. He also brought the wine list and our menus. I ordered a bottle of champagne and that came up quickly too.We enjoyed our champagne and although David checked with us a couple of times, we never felt rushed to order our meal. We finally did order, and our friend Jose made sure he told David that he did not like garlic at all. Jose ordered some fish, and from the menu description it did not seem that there was any garlic, and off David went.After our first course had arrived, (I had the cold foie gras which was outstanding), David returned to inform Jose that he had checked with the chef and although there was no garlic in the sauce, it seemed that there was a touch of it in the marinade so David recommended another one of the two remaining fish dishes. Jose ordered one of those. I thought that was very conscientious of our server to double check on that.I ordered the rack of lamb which was prepared perfectly and was quite enjoyable. Our friend Jose thought his fish was great and his wife Ana said her steak was the best she had had in Las Vegas. My wife had steak as well and it was wonderful.The desserts were incredible. I had a three-dimensional experience of perfectly ripened and sliced bananas to form a tower filled with dark chocolate and buttressed by white chocolate. It was outrageously good!During our dinner, the water show at the Bellagio produced some ooohs and ahhs, but at our table it was the dinner that got all the accolades.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

They offer a view of the fountains at the Bellagio, but what they don't say is that you have to get lucky enough to be seated at a table that you can see them. They are not visible from the entire restaurant. The one thing I did not like is that you have to cancel your reservations within 4 hours of your time. This is a little crazy because if you have something that keeps you from being on time, it usually does not give you four hours notice!! The dress code says business casual, but it is much more formal than that and so we felt out of place. Our meal was $194 and we all had appetizers and tea. But, if you don't mind paying a few hundres dollars for small dishes, this is the place!! The staff was pretty friendly but were are pretty stiff. For all I know, this could be what they promote to be their style. It was ok, but not really what is advertised.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Pricey, yes, but worth it for a special occasion. Thumbs up!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The service is impecable and friendly, not an easy combination. The food is fresh and thoughtfully prepared and delicious. I had the chef's tasting menu with the wine pairing. The food and wine complimented each other perfectly and the portions were spot on to be able to finish them all. As a single diner, I am sometimes not treated with much respect but here, I was given the same attention as larger parties, something important to me as a traveler. As the dessert with the 5 chocolate imterpretations, unbelievable. I will be back.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Oct. 2nd: Celebrating our Anniversary in Vegas it was difficult selecting a Restaurant. So I chose 2!! Cut Steakhouse was wonderful ,but Eiffel Tower surpassed it mainly because of the View and easier on the wallet. A table facing the Bellagio Fountain Water Show can't be beat! It's so easy to settle in and relax then enjoy a wonderful leisurely meal. Good wine, wonderful service and a view of the Strip/ Water Show. Perfect to relax and unwind. Our added Bonus was Pierre, our charming server. His french accent just added to the ambience ! Five grain ciabbatta and sourdough rolls wonderful. I had Surf and Turf and Tom enjoyed a perfectly prepared Strip Steak with a bottle of very good, yet affordable Wine..shared au gratin potatoes and preordered Caramel Souffle for dessert. Surprise Chocolate Mousse for Anniversary.Pierre was at our beck and call. Unobtrusive yet he does cater to you ! Our plan is to celebrate our Anniversary here every year we can get to Vegas and one day hope for a corner table which sure looked like the best one in the place! As we were settling up our bill and readying to leave, an attractive blonde with what looked like her also attractive mother sat at the table next to us. So, alas, Pierre was leaning in to welcome and assist them with meal suggestions and spreading that French Charm at their table. They were in for a treat! Our 65th Anniversary Celebration was perfect in every way. Hugs and kisses to everyone who works there especially Pierre and the Chef !</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Food-B-</title><review>After much consideration and reviews I decided to book this for our anniversary. I am glad I did, but I do want to review the restaurant as a whole and share what I thought was good, and what was bad. The most amazing thing about this restaurant and really the only reason I would consider going back was the view. We had the best seat in the house on the corner. Direct view of the Bellagio Fountains and the strip. It made for amazing ambiance, and you really get to take in the beauty of Vegas at night. I have eaten at Mix and the view from you table is much better at the ETR, then Mix. The service was also outstanding and I really appreciated the Sommelier visiting us right as we were sat, as ordering a bottle is the first thing we usually do. All night long, we really had top notch service, as good if not better then any other high end restaurant we have eaten at. The down side to the evenging was overall the food. It is not that it was bad because it wasn't, it is just that it wasn't great and I have had much better gastric experiences in Vegas. We had the Blue Cheese Souffle which actually was really good, and the chocolate souffle was pretty good (not the best we have ever had) but pretty good. For dinner I had the lamb and I imagine if Lamb is your thing, this was probably pretty good. It was cooked perfectly. I personally didn't like it and neither did my wife. Apparantly it is a best seller so again if you like lamb, it is probably your thing. My wife had the surf and turf and it was far from impressive in my book and hers. I have had better steaks for less than $15, and the lobster just wasn't that great either. Overall both of our meals were bad but for the price they don't match. One other side note, the restaurant was noisy, which didn't bother us a whole lot, but it was by no means a quiet evening dinner. If you want great food, I would say look elsewehere, if you want a memorable view/romantic evening, then give it a shot. Our tab was about $500 with wine, tip, food, and I had roses at the table. Of course depending on your wine preference your tab can get pretty high up there. You can get by on food for around $200.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Sure the cost is a little more expensive than your average restaurant but that sums it up, The Eiffel Tower is not an average restaurant. I can't say enough good things! We had a perfect view of the Bellagio water fountains as well. It was a birthday that both of us will never forget.

Overall: BEST PART? it was a Romantic atmosphere with no screaming children ruining the best night of my life with my husband.

We were seated right away, and were never rushed nor ignored. We will go back there for the tasting menu next time we are in Vegas. I can't say enough about how great this place is, from the fact that you couldn't drink a 1/4 of water without it being refilled, to the guy who scraps the crumbs off the table. I never felt like they were intruding, they were very careful to make sure we were happy. The food was fantastic, my lambchops were exactly how I ordered them (rare) and the desert was perfect.

Boy, am I glad we did. The service, food and ambience are all impeccable! We arrived for our reservation, and the lovely, young hostess brought us to a window table in a very tight corner... so we asked if we could wait for a better table. It was not an issue at all, so we proceeded to the bar to have a glass of champagne. A minute later the hostess came and said the best seat in the house was available... the opposite corner table with an amazing strip view. I know that I can be a pain, but the table was too romantic for me, and the doll of a hostess said a middle table would be available soon. It was worth the wait for this great table.Of course, I had to tip the patient hostess for all the trouble. She was so obliging. The server turned out to be another outstanding service person. He was so smooth in his delivery on every level.Onto the food! This restaurant serves some of the best cuisine we have ever experienced. The cauliflower amuse bouche was a great start, but the bleu cheese souffle appetizer was amazing! The seared foie gras with pears was melt in your mouth delicious, as well.The rack of lamb was perfectly cooked and sooo tender and the glazed turnips were a beautiful addition to these wonderful tasting dish.How can you even describe the gratin of potatoes... how about out of this world! Creamy, cheesy, and sinful.The brussels sprouts with bacon were perfectly cooked and tasted great, but then again not really special. I thought it might be something healthy with all the rich food. Like bacon is healthy.The crowning glory of this sumptuous meal was the incredible pistachio souffle. Light and airy, with a fabulous sauce, it is a must order if you love pistachios.We are heading to Vegas again in June, and already have an Opentable booking for this excellent restaurant. Can't wait to try the slow poached lobster !</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

I can't say enough about the attention we were shown. Lyle is wonderful - I communicated with him through email making our reservations before our trip to Las Vegas and he came by our table to introduce himself and welcome us. All of our servers were absolutely wonderfully attentive and friendly. We had a lovely table by the window with a view of the Bellagio fountains, which was a treat to see from the 11th floor! The sunset behind Bellagio was beautiful as it lit the mountains. Oh yes, and then there is the food! We started with a glass of champagne (very nice) and had a very good bottle of wine. We went with the tasting menu and are we ever happy that we did! Every course was delicious and beautifully presented. We ordered dessert - I had the chocolate souffle which was, I think, the best chocolate dessert I have ever had! My husband ordered the Napoleon which was delicious. But before they brought our desserts, they treated us to a chocolate mousse on a plate that read "Happy Anniversary" along with a sampling of sorbets (7 of them I believe). Such a treat! It is expensive - but this is a wonderful place for a special occasion and we will not hesitate to return when we go back to Las Vegas! We look forward to it!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

After reading the reviews I was looking forward to some top quality french food, but was left disappointed. I have eaten in many French restaurants in the UK and in France and the food here was poor in comparison. Essentially you pay for the view and the food is an American/Vegas version of a french restaurant. Not authentic.4 of us all opted for the tasting menu and with a bottle of cheap ($140) champagne. the bill came to over $600. I don't mind paying this much for a fancy meal, but it was not value for money and the courses ranged from OK to pretty awful. I gave a decent tip, but clearly not enough as when I arrived home I found that they took an extra $10 from my card above what I have on the receipt!? I find this unacceptable and feel I have been ripped off.Overall I would not recommend this place at all and if you are visiting from overseas, I would suggest paying by cash to avoid them overcharging your card (and only finding out when you return home).</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

I corresponded with Lyle concerning this particular dinner, and he was helpful -- turns out that timing matters with this restaurant, and he suggested the seating time (6:45) that would give "the kids" the greatest variety of visual treats through the glass windows, as well as a splendid meal. This was my report to Lyle following the meal last week: "I wanted to send my thanks for hosting my nephews and niece at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant last week. "They loved it ! "They had looked at the menu ahead of time and Tom and Kim were excited because it was so unique and offered such culinary adventure. Paul, who is older and less adventuresome with food, initially feared there was nothing on the menu he could eat (because nothing looked familiar -- he's had only "steak-house food" experiences. As he says, "I'm a meat and potatoes man.)" "He eventually order the halibut and a napoleon -- and loved it! Really, how can you not like good food imaginatively and impeccably prepared. He is proud he ate every morsel, and enjoyed it immensely. You provided him a unique moment in his limited experience with fine cuisine. "Tom and Kim, considerably more familiar with a wide range of food and food preparation and presentation, were more at ease with the menu. If they could afford it, they would seek out this class of cuisine often and would love it. (They did take a photo of every dish to send to their Aunt Kathy (me). "The whole evening was more than they had hoped. The seating was perfect, the wait staff were kind and attentive, the food was splendid beyond expectation, they loved the sunset and the onset of Las Vegas lights at night. And when the wind-restricted Bellagio fountains finally came on during their dessert, they were in heaven. "Thank you for stopping by their table. They were surprised and pleased, and you made them feel quite special. "I thought Kim gave the most astute compliment. She told me "I put myself through college as a waitress. I know what it takes and how hard it is to bring everything together and to create a perfect dining experience. This was perfection." "Thank you, Lyle!

I measure not only the obvious things apparent to a standard diner, but the subtle things that turn a fine restaurant into an outstanding experience. For this alone the Eiffel Tower restaurant would earn this review. The food is excellent, always well prepared with presentation to match. However there is more, the VIEW. If you ask for a window seat, you overlook Las Vegas blvd, and directly across the street are the Bellagio fountains. Not at the street level view, but from 4 stories up. The location is just far enough away to see the entire panorama in one view. On special occasions you can ask for the corner table and then it turns spectacular. Some might see the price and say it is too much, but they miss the point that this is entertainment with some of the best dishes you will find anywhere. When you get off the elevator the kitchen is right in front of you for full viewing. Only a very self assured Chef would do this, and he has every reason to be so confident. It has been my experience that service is a reflection of the manager's values. Lyle, the manager, visits every table and is constantly monitoring for quality. Management by walking around is the best kind and he verifies that the service is subtle and timely, something very difficult to achieve. No I don't own stock, they earned this review.Richard Oertlerichard_oertle @hotmail.com</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The coffee is excellent and the refills kept coming. I chose the chop chop chicken salad and it was very light tasting yet filling. This will be a must stop on every future Vegas trip.

There aren't enough wonderful adjectives to describe the experience! The setting is so romantic! We had a beautiful window table facing the fountain show at the Bellagio and the greater Strip view. On our table were the most beautiful roses and rose petals and fabulous red Eiffel Tower plates. The service was extraordinary and we did not want for a thing! The blue cheese souffle starter was amazing, as was our entire meal! We also appreciated the expertise of the restaurant's sommelier who assisted us in selecting the perfect bottle of wine to accompany our meal. We had pre-ordered a caramel souffle to share for dessert and while I went to the ladies's room, apparently the manager came over and apologized to my husband for the delay and provided the souffle and a delicious sorbet selection to us complimentary! Honestly we were enjoying ourselves so much, we hadn't even noticed the dessert was late! That is the kind of attention and service you can expect at this fine restaurant. It is worth every penny! We will make this a regular part of our Las Vegas itinerary from now on! Go and have the best dining experience!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

While one could not be guaranteed for me, they did say that they would put rose petals down and see what they could do.When we arrived, we asked again for a window seat and were told it would be a few minutes (we were early for our reservation). It was well worth the wait, as we ended up with the best table possible in the house. It was right on the corner, overlooking the bellagio fountains. We saw several shows and were completely enamored with the sight.The food was excellent as well, though on the expensive side as you would expect in Vegas. I had the beef wellington which was one of the best I've ever had, only topped by that served by Gibbys in Old Montreal. Service was also outstanding, our waiter was friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu. Food arrived quickly as well. After the dinner, we returned to our suite and I proposed - she said yes! Will definitely always remember our dinner at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary and this was known only by the representative taking our booking as far as we knew. To our surprise we were seated at a gorgeous table in the corner of the restaurant with the most amazing view of the strip and the Bellagio fountain with red rose petals adorning our table when we were seated. The service and food was perfect. We have eaten in Paris and the French influence in the food was obvious and of high quality. I did eat the blue cheese soufflé and I am so pleased I did not read the review above before I dined as I may not have ordered it. Mine was so lovely and an appropriate size for an appetizer. The staff had impeccable timing, we never felt rushed or in need of any greater service. Our waiter had a good knowledge of the wines and listened to our likes and dislikes before recommending a wine that he felt would suit us, he was right of course and even presented us with the label from the bottle in a card as a memory of our anniversary. We were also presented with a complimentary chocolate mousse to share with "Happy Anniversary" written in chocolate around the plate. This is a restaurant that will give you not only gorgeous food to enjoy a culinary experience, it will also give you a wonderful evening where you are treated so beautifully and appropriately you will leave having experienced the whole package. Thank you to everyone involved on our dinner for making this a wonderful event to celebrate 25 years of marriage.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The "small" blue cheese souffle was the size of a small hat, stringy with cheese, and accompanied by a salty-as-the-ocean salad. The bread was hard, thick and cold, the "baguette" unlike anything I've experienced in France. The sturgeon was presented within (neither on top or below) a sauce that tasted for all the world like Campbell's Cream of Mushroom, and, more surprisingly, with McCormick French Onion Dip sprinkled on top. The fish was soggy, but who wouldn't be soggy if bathed in soup and topped with dip mix? Perhaps the fish was perfectly OK before cooking. My dinner partner's scallop appetizer was too salty, but also lightly dusted with McCormick's. The "medium-rare" lamb was OK, but the taste reminded us, somehow, of gyros. Finally, the desert souffle was beautiful, but too sweet and heavy compared to Le Cirque's (across the street), Commander's Palace, or that little all-souffle place on Rue du Mont Thabor in Paris. More like bread pudding than souffle. To sum up, it's as if the Eiffel Tower Restaurant was taken down, reassembled in Las Vegas, and run by people who were neither French nor had found the operating manual for the kitchen.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Our waiter, Valentino, was exceptional in every way from recommending wine, to accomodating my husband's shellfish allergies, to main course and dessert. He made sure we knew that the table was ours for the night letting us know there was no rush in celebrating our anniversary. The supevisor, Lyle, came over to congratulate us and to thank us for sharing our special event . The food was outstanding. I had the lobster salad and Beef Wellington (mouth waters just typing it) and my husband had the New York Strip along with sides of potato au gratin and creamed spinach. The souffle was superb, another great suggestion by Valentino. My husband who is one of the pickest eaters in the world, couldn't stop thanking me for selecting the Eiffel Tower. Truly the highlight of our week-long anniversary celebration in Vegas. People talk about the price, but you absolutely get what you pay for here.

We wanted a nicer restaurant and one with a view. Because I have food allergies, we needed a place that could accommodate that. This restaurant respected and accommodated my food allergies well.The restaurant has a nice bar area set apart from the tables. We had requested a table at the window so we could see the Bellagio fountains. The restaurant met our request, but unfortunately it was a windy night and the Bellagio cancelled their fountain performances. The restaurant atmosphere was enjoyable regardless.We had a wonderful half bottle of wine. It was L'Ecole No 41, which is a cabernet sauvignon from Washington state and not like any I had tasted before. (I am not a wine coinesseur by any means though.) For food, the chef specially prepared a lobster appetizer I could eat without allergens and I simply had the roast chicken for my main meal. The chef also made me a baked potato specially given my allergies. The chicken was very good. My companion had the monkfish dish and brussel sprout side. He thought it was really good. Regretfully, we could not eat dessert because I was allergic to everything. But, the table next to us got the souffle and it looked great.The service at our table was wonderful. Attentive, but not overly so. And, the waiter took my food allergies seriously and did his best to create a nice meal for me.The food and wine was quite pricey.

This restaurant is inside the Eiffel Tower at the Paris Casino. Ambiance and service was top-notch.As for the actual food / wine, we were given the wine list and 98% of the wines were over $100 a bottle. I was hard-pressed to find a wine between $50 and $80. I ordered a new appetizer for the restaurant (escargot, sweet breads, and poached egg); an interesting combination, but very poorly executed by the chef. I'll leave out the details, but having had escargot and sweet breads in other top-end restaurants, this was the very poorly done for a high-end restaurant. My friend had the scallops and although they were cooked well, they tasted bland. It needs a better sauce to spice it up a little. The manager did remove my appetizer from the bill and the waiter was very apologetic. For my entree I had the lamb dish, which was good, but I've had better. My friend had the Fillet Mignon, which was also good. We skipped dessert. Bill came to $230 for two people! Definitely not worth it. If you want to enjoy the view, have a drink at the bar.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We knew the food would be pricey and it was. The food was good but not really outstanding. The service was very good. The view from my room was better than the view we had from our table. Because the tables are jammed together, it is very noisey so if you have alot of people eating together, you cannot hear one another. Beware that they do not give separate checks. For 14 people at a table this is a nightmare. They basically brought the check and said "have at it". The waiter offered no help in sorting out who owed what. This situation is never good and made what would have been at least a pleasant birthday dinner end on a bad note. For the money you pay to eat here the least they could do is separate the check. Because of this alone, I would not eat here again. I am sure you can get good food at a better price somewhere else. I think that they wanted to see a group women wrestle over the check. I am suprised that they didn't have a mud ring in the middle of the restaurant for the entertainment!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The Eiffel Tower Restaurant was my choice and I was so happy it was. From the moment we got on the elevator we were impressed, the elevator opens up basically in front of the kitchen staff, the kitchen is very impressive and so clean. As you walk past the kitchen you enter the dining room, the atmosphere was very charming and romantic. Our table was ready as I made the reservation a couple weeks before. I had requested a window seat with a view of the bellagio fountains, and that is exactly what we had ! Amazinf view of the Las vegas strip as well, we just sat and enjoyed this whole experience for some time. Our waiter was excellent, we did not feel rushed in any way, we relaxed with a drink as we looked through the menu, there are many choices, but we decided on the tasting menu. Each course was excellent and came in a timely fashion, our waiter even asked if we wanted to take a break between courses to relax, so in no way were they trying to turn tables fast like some of the reviews I have read on here, we could of stayed all nite and we almost did. The Tasting menu gives you many different types of foods that you would otherwise not have the opportunity to try had you order just one entree, it is a bit on the pricey side, but what do you expect when you dine at an establishment of this caliber. From a delicate mushroom appetizer to Beef Tenderloin medallions, Sea bass was one of the entrees, i am sure a fish lover would enjoy this, we are not as it was a bit to fishy for our tastes, to end it though the desert that was so amazing ! The portions are of good size and with the tasting menu be prepared for alot of food. I am not a wine drinker, but my wife enjoyed a high end red wine which she loved, mind you at 22.00 a glass. The heineken was cold, and at 6.00 it was comparable to anywhere else in vegas. We were so happy we decided on going to the Eiffel tower, yes it is very expensive, roughly 100 per person for the tasting menu, plus drinks, but we would not hesitate to return as it is one of our favorite memories of our recent Vegas vacation !</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

I was a bit reluctant to book it because I thought it might be like the real Eiffel Tower restaurant, Jules Verne, used to be; decent, but far over priced due to its setting.I was very pleasantly surprised. The setting is indeed quite spectacular, and we had a table right at the window over looking the Bellagio fountains. So, point one for sitting us there without having to ask (when I made the reservation, I told them it was my wife's birthday). The view at night is stunning when the water show is happening or when it isn't.Overall, the food was excellent and in a few cases, amazing--what you would nearly demand from a restaurant in this price range. Any restaurant in this price range needs to have some items in the spectacular range. Here, the bleu cheese souffle fit that bill as well as the pheasant breast. All items were very high quality. Though bleu cheese souffle sounds a bit odd, I can promise you it is not quite what you might think and out of this world.Service was great through out. The kind of service that does not intrude, makes things happen and lets you concentrate on your dinner partner, the food and the setting.Yes, the price is expensive--likely $250 to $400 per couple realistically--but they deliver, and do not just rely on the location and setting.Not the top in Las Vegas, but very solid.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The food was outstanding, beautifully cooked and presented, probably the best steak I've ever had. The wine list is quite comprehensive although beware, the prices are steep (a half bottle was £46). Remember though if this is a special meal it's well worth pushing the boat out as you will not regret eating here.

It was a table for two that was seated at the window overlooking the Bellagio Fountains. It was fantastic. Very Romantic.Food: Very very good. We didn’t stuff ourselves as we had to sit through a show after (nothing worse than being full and sleepy!) I ordered the Surf and Turf which was a tenderloin cooked perfectly with a topping of crab. It was drizzled in mustard sauce which was excellent. I think it was the best I ate the whole trip. I ordered a side of Galette Potato Anna which is sliced roasted potatoes which were good. My Partner orders the Sea Bass. He said it was good, but my steak was better. As it was my Birthday they brought me out a plate with chocolate decoration and Sorbet (I can’t eat cream) which was awesome. Service: The service was excellent. Never had to wait for anything. All questions were answered and they made sure that they asked about allergies and if it was a special occasion, etc.All in all. A great meal.

Since they open at 5pm for dinner, we pretty much had a choice of tables to sit. We sat at one of the tables for 2 right along the windows facing the strip. It was so magnificent!! Especially when the Bellagio fountains danced and when the sun went down and the lights of the strip came on. Our entrees were amazingly delicious!! My husband had the beef wellington and I had the rack of lamb. Savory with each and every bite. Our waiter was Mike and he was hands down the best waiter we had the entire trip. Extremely attentive with excellent recommendations on wine and side dishes. He even took a nice picture of us with the Paris balloon outside behind us. Yes, the meal was expensive!! But we got what we paid for, and it was perfect for that special dinner. The ambience was so romantic. I am still remembering that lamb..........

The food at the Eiffel Tower was very good. We had the pate and it was wonderful and luxurious. Two in our group had the Crusted Salmon and it was outstanding! I had Sea Bass and it also was wonderful. We shared the chocolate plate with a variety of small chocolate desserts and we all enjoyed it. Unfortunately, we were unable to sit at the window, but we enjoyed the view none the less. The only complaint was, due to it's popularity it was a little like being at Disney World.....nonstop motion. We were seated a little further than center of the restaurant and between the waiters rushing around and people being seated, it was not as pleasant as it could have been. The other concern was our waiter's reaction to my gluten issues. I had emailed the restaurant in advance and was told that there was no problem. The waiters are informed and can recommend GF items and they also know which items can be modified. Our waiter didn't want to be bothered. His comment was that almost everything has gluten. When I asked about two specific items he said yes they are gf. I hate to make an issue in a restaurant and I know that most restaurant food has gluten. But nowadays, even the simplest restaurants can accomodate gluten issues if they are willing. I would expect The Eiffel Tower restaurant to be at least as accomodating as any other restaurant and that wasn't the case.Overall, we enjoyed the food and view, but once is probably enough.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Food was great, I haven't had a beef wellington as good in years. My wife's veal was excellent as well. The wine list is long but very expensive but there are some decent values by their standards to be found in the wines listed from WA or OR.

Although it has good overall ratings on tripadvisor, we did not have a good meal experience.One positive note was the view. I have to give the restaurant credit for having a nice atmosphere and great view. However, although we had reservations and there were many empty tables, we were told we could not have a window seat. We had a nice view, but not nearly as nice as if we'd been seated at the window. When we were finished with our dinner, there were still empty seats by the window that had been empty when we arrived. Therefore, It was puzzling that we were refused a window seat.The food was decent, but not great. This might have been alright, if it wasn't so expensive. I had Filet Mignon which, although it was very tender, was quite bland. It had so little flavor that it seemed a waste of such a tender piece of meat. My husband had a steak which also just had an okay flavor.For us, the worst part of our meal was the service. Our waiter was not rude, but provided service that was slow and indifferent. Our water and iced tea glasses were often left empty. It seemed like our waiter would disappear for periods of time so twice we had to ask other waiters for help. Our waiter didn't seem to care when we indicated we were not happy with our steaks.We left this restaurant very disappointed. Based on other's reviews, we had planned to eat here as the highlight of our meals in Las Vegas during this visit. It was the most expensive restaurant we ate at during our trip, yet it was the least enjoyable meal experience. So for us, this restaurant was definitely not worth it.To give Paris it's due, we did eat at Mon Ami Gabi and enjoyed it very much. I'd just suggest heading there instead of the Eiffel Tower.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The food and service are excellent. The view is superb (you can watch the water show across the street at Bellagio from the window tables). The prices are less than half of what you'd pay at one of the snootier places, and it would not be as good as it was at Eiffel Tower. We had a great time, and the food was hearty and tasty. The service was not as impeccable as at the shi-shi places (you didn't have five people hovering over your every whim), but it was nearly perfect, and we had a much better time than at Joel Robuchon. The drinks were better. The food was better. The view and surroundings were better. We just had a much better overall enjoyment. We ate a lot more food, and the bill was half what it was at the other place. I'll let the photos speak for themselves.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

You have to take a private express elevator which simulates going through the Eiffel Tower and when the elevator doors open, you step into the kitchen of the restaurant. Very cool! The bar is very modern and sleek and the view is SPECTACULAR! Try to get a table near the window so that you can see the Bellagio Hotel's fountain show. Our waiter was very informative and recommended several dishes to us which were outstanding. I had the Autumn Salad (which I'm trying to replicate at home), the Baked Cod and Pistachio Souffle for dessert. Everyone in our party claimed that their meal was the best ever! Highly recommend to anyone traveling to Vegas...</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

It was an evening dinner and the sight was magnificant with all the strip lit up. The food was very good, but beware it is very expensive. Two cocktails at the bar, were $22 before tip. Steaks for two with potatoes and a vegetable for one ,including dessert for two was $190. We did not have any additional drinks or appetizers. I will say the portions are very large, and can easily be split. It is a wonderful experience, and even if you do it only once for the memory, well worth it.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The chef here is from the Alsace region of France and tends to lean towards what we call 'proper' French food. :-) i.e. Lots of perfectly cooked meat and lovely heavy rich French sauces. The food was superb. My husband had the blue cheese souffle - to die for. I had steak with a red wine reduction sauce. Yes, a bit boring but I felt like it and I have my steak well done, but it was the most tender steak I've had in a while. Also the sauce was excellent, and the sauce that came with my husbands dish even better - a pinot reduction. OMG. We finished with a PROPER souffle each. Light as air and puffy - very delicate and delicious. We didn't come away feeling ill but nicely comfortable. The service was second to none - you don't find service like that very often. Friendly server, knowlegable, accomodating, relaxing and superb skills. Beautiful service. We got a lovely table that looked right over to Bellagio and the fountains, so they played all night. Also they have a fabulous singer there called Sarah who sounds like Norah Jones and suited the restaurant perfectly. I usually hate that sort of thing, but it added to the evening. I can't rate this highly enough. It was a brilliant experience and worth getting the premier tickets for the Eiffel Tower lift after your meal and going to see Vegas at night - excellent. We would highly recommend this restaurant.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The view is the best Las Vegas has to offer, I was very pleased with the prices and selections of wine offered. The Lamb, smoked salmon and and foie gras were really perfectly executed, and the souffles were a perfect ending. The menu has something for everyone and not over the top.

I also wanted to give people an idea of the prices before you go there.It is very expensive, and to be honest I'm not sure if the price reflects the quality of the food. I just found the food to be ok, nothing special.I proposed to my girlfriend in the restaurant and had requested a table with a good view of the Bellagio fountains. When we arrived we were given a table which was facing the south of the strip, with a slight view of the fountains. Having said that they did say they would give us the next available table if we wanted to wait.If you order steak (for $50) you just get steak! Nothing extra. And there is ONE vegetarian main on the menu, although you could have a selection of starters as a main.Cocktails start at $18-20 each.When I tried to book the table for the engagement they tried to sell me a ridiculously overpriced package starting at $500, where you have a standard meal but they just chuck in a few roses and a trip to see the top of the tower! If you are planning to propose I really wouldn't recommend paying for this package!I'll end on a good note... our waiter Pierre was superb. He was funny and so helpful. I was planning the standard engagement ring in the champagne glass proposal, but Pierre got us a special (free) cake with a sugary "cage" over the ring.So I would say it's a nice restaurant, but I wouldn't say it's the best I've ever been to. Perhaps one of the Bellagio restaurants or Tao at the Venetian might be nicer.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We are no strangers to elegant meals. While the food was great, the service was lacking. I booked well in advance and requested a window table overlooking the fountains since we were celebrated my boyfriends birthday. The table we were escorted to was in the corner with more of a view of Bally's than that Bellagio which was disappointing. After dinner we were too full for dessert (which almost never happens), our wine was done and the table was cleared. With no wine left and telling the waiter we were not partaking in dessert, it took him 30 minutes to get the bill to us. Now, had our wine not been finished, we wouldn't have minded waiting while we were sipping and conversing but the table was clear, no water, no wine, nothing. It truly made an unforgettable experience one I'd care to forget. We probably won't be returning....</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

At first we were seated away from the window view, but when we asked for a window view they were very nice and found one immediately. It was a busy night and there were only two reservations available when we booked the previous evening. Be sure to book a reservation in advance and they will require a credit card to reserve.We both had terrific dishes. The menu was al a carte. We each had a cesar salad for starter. Then we had a beef filet wrapped with sauteed mushrooms inside a crust entree which was very delicious. Also had a filet mignon entree which was very delicious and well portioned. We each had a side of potatoes (each cooked different). One side for both would have been plenty. The meal with gratuity was $180.Early on we told our waiter we were kinda tight on time and he was awesome and the food was timely. We were able to make it across to the Bellagio were we stayed, changed to more relaxed clothes and made it to the Venetian for a comedy show at 9p with David Spade. Awesome restaurant with awesome view, staff and atmosphere.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Just tell him you are going up for a glass of wine at the bar. Many people seated at the bar are waiting for tables but there are no rules.

When the elevator doors open you are at the froint of the kitchen and walk around to the front of the restaurant. We were quickly escorted to our amazing front row seats directly in front of the Bellagio fountain show! The waiter was excellent and offered very nice tips for the menu and wine selection. We didn't find anythingon the wine list so the manager came over and asked if we wanted to try something off the menu. We selected an 07 Beaujolais and were very impressed!! When dining we tend to try degustation or tasting menus as they give us an idea of the chefs in the restaurants. This was no different 6 courses, but we were pressed for time and needed to be done in 90 minutes, the waiter assured me he has done this tasting in 45 minutes before. We were sold! The food was better than average but I wouldn't say I had to have anything on that menu again but the soup! Corn soup with clams, delicious, a 5 star item on a 3.5 star menu. Our final meat course was not spiced properly or at all for that matter. Cooked perfectly with no spice, not even salt or pepper.The dessert is my wifes favourite thing and she wanted the creme brulee but was disappointed when the top came soggy and not crusty as it should, with caramelized sugar. The waiter finally talked her into another one and it was much better.The atmosphere is impeccable, with music playing in the background and fountains displaying in front, service was first class all the way.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We had made reservations, and upon arrival we asked the hostess if we could possibly get seats overlooking the Belliago. We waited at the bar until she came and got us, and we were seated overlooking the fountains. An amazing view. Our waiter was excellent, always ensuring that our glasses were full. I ordered the pistachio souffle while my wife ordered the chocolate. As previously mentioned, you order these desserts first. They are delicious and well worth the price and I do not normally eat desserts.We ordered the lobster cake appetizer which was great. For the main course my wife ordered the sword fish and I ordered the lamb....both were amazing. Very tasty. We ordered the mushroom and spinach sides and that was good as well.For drinks we got a half bottle of red wine...but later ordered another half bottle. The wine ended up being around 100 dollars, but it was good. I believe it was the swanson merlot from napa valley.Our total bill was around 330 dollars. It was the most expensive meal I have ever had, but it was the most delicious and fulfilling. You only live once right. If you can afford it, you should definately check out this restaurant.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

What they didn't tell me was that they allowed in families who were going to be right next to you to spoil your romantic evening. We had the delights of a baby, who screamed throughout our meal, parked in a stroller the size of the Bellagio. Now we realized that they were making a heck more money out of this family than out of us- they were all on bottles of cahmpagne followed by wine- but I just wish you were told this up front. As it stood, I could have had more romance dining at Denny's, and I wouldn't have paid $360 for it. The meal itself was ok- we had the tasting menu with wines- but the service was poor, with some wines being served after the courses. I undertipped but still felt the pain of parting with a lot of money for a less than perfect evening.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

When we got off the elevator, there were 2 samples waiting for us. A cheese canape and a salmon bite. We started our meal with an "amuse bouche" of pistachio souffle and cheese puffs. Wow! I had the french petite four sandwiches (lunch). Each bite was sublime. Served with homemade fingerling potato chips. If I squinted my eyes and daydreamed just bit I could imagine being at a cafe in the 6th with my loved one having a romantic date. *Sigh*</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The steak was delicious though. We also had some excellent potatoes au gratin.Because it was our anniversary, our server gave us some free chocolate mousse and it said "Happy Anniversary" on the plate. We also ordered a rasberry napoleon which had too much rasberries for our taste. We also had a few chocolates for free at the end of the meal.It was a very romantic environment especially with the fountains, but we wished we could have heard the music to the fountains. There was a bit too much noise from the servers with the dishes.We got a formal picture in front of the fountains and in front of the Paris balloon.I would go back but on a very special occasion.

We noticed the reservations desk for the Eiffel Tower Restaurant and inquired as to any availability that evening for dinner as it was our anniversary. The Hostess was very pleasant and, as luck would have it, someone must have canceled so we reserved a sitting for 8:00pm! Upon our arrival, we were a tad early and they were running late on their reservations - no worries. We absorbed the view of the Vegas Strip from the lounge and relaxed with a drink. We were seated approximately 30 minutes later to a FABULOUS table at the window which overlooked the Bellagio water show and shortly thereafter Caesar's fireworks show! We couldn't have planned it better if we tried!! We had wonderful service from our server, Jorge "George" (many thanks) and the food was out of this world! My Beef Wellington was to die for! If you ever get the chance, splurge and have dinner at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant.

The highlight of our honeymoon.</title><review>This really was incredible. We still regularly talk about how great it was. I had made a booking in advance, told them it was our honeymoon, asked for a view and also ordered the red roses that they offer on the booking site. After getting a disappointing view in the Hancock Tower restaurant in Chicago I was all prepared to give the MaitreD a big tip in order to get a good table. We desperately wanted a good view of the Bellagio. We went for our meal at 7pm (on a week night in June) and i started saying to the person that it was our honeymoon and we were hoping for a good view. They said 'of course no problem' and took us to what must have been one of the best three tables in the restaurant. Incredible vista of the Bellagio and it's fountains. Tom introduced himself as our head waiter and all night we were extremely well looked after by Tom and one other waiter who was also very friendly. Then came Lyle! Lyle was the supervisor and introduced himself asking if there was anything we needed. We got chatting and he ended up giving us his business card saying if we need anything at all just let him know. Maybe he does that with everyone, i dont know and i dont care. He was great and made us feel like we were special customers. Hey if they make everyone feel like that then thats great! The meal was incredible and managed to stretch it out for over two hours to watch the fountains in daylight and night time after the sun went down. They didnt rush us or anything. It was an amazing meal and a night we will remember for a long time.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The overall ambiance of the place is great, but the place was very warm when we got off of the elevator to get to the restaurant. We arrived 10 minutes early for our reservation. After waiting 15 minutes we were told by the hostess that the party at our table was done dining and had paid their bill, but wasn't leaving for some reason. This went on for a half hour. We wanted to watch the fireworks and had a great table reserved for the occasion but neither the hostess nor the server mentioned to the previous party that the table was spoken for. This was AFTER the previous party had gotten up to leave only to sit back down once the fireworks started. We were just about ready to leave when they finally let us have our table after the fireworks were over. Splendid. Our party of 6 was very displeased and we almost walked knowing that all we were going to hear was a weak apology after another. Our waiter then sensed we were displeased when the whole table ordered nothing but water and salads. I was not going to give them any extra business. We had the reservations for over 2 months and told them it was for a special occasion. Two people in our party got apps and 2 got dessert. My "tomato" salad was just that. One slice of tomato with some buffalo mozzarella on top with some leaves of lettuce all for the unbelievable price of $18. EIGHTEEN dollars for one slice of tomato for a tomato salad. My 2 buddies spring salads were a few leaves of lettuce with one small carrot and some oil and vinegar. These were only $15 a piece. Wendy's makes a better salad for $5. Our waiter knew we weren't going to rack up a big bill which we intended to do. We had plans for 2 bottles of bubbly and everyone was going to order one of their $45-$60 entrees. I am glad we didn't since the salads were completely unimpressive and tremendously overpriced. Our bill for 5 salads, 2 apps and 2 desserts was $183 which included the 18% tip. I would not recommend this place unless someone else is paying. I will not go back.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

There was absolutely no need to embarrass my friend like that ! Secondly ,after each person was finished their starter ,no sooner had someone placed their knife and fork down did the waiter take the plate from under them even though the rest of us were still eating which I found very rude.Throughtout the main course ,the waiter asked us 5 times if everything was ok which i found very annoying .We were sat at a bad table (even though we asked to be seated in a different spot ) so one of our diners had a steel frame of the tower as her view.Our table was right beside the spot where the waiters congregate and have the cuttery ,spare plates etc so during our meal as the end of night approached all we could hear was the clunking of cuttlery and alot of chat from the wait staff which was very offputting .When arranging the money for the bill ,the waiter was standing directly behind me and no sooner had I closed the envelope ,did he swoop in and grab the envelope/wallet of cash ....which was atrocious !Food was nice although very rich for my pallet .Value for money was ok but service was extremely poor and I think the overall experience was dissapointing .I would never darken their door again !</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

How often do you get to watch the Bellagio water fountain show from that angle? We were mesmerized by the water fountain show and that's about it. We made reservations for 9:30PM and were seated right away at a table with a window. The menu seemed promising with the delectable descriptions. We were excited to try a variety of dishes. There was also a prefixed menu for $89 and wine pairings for an additional $69. After looking at the prefixed menu, we were more interested in trying dishes ala carte. We decided to try the New York Strip with Bone Marrow, Sauteed Swordfish, Escargot appetizer, Crispy Pommes Dauphines, and Asparagus. We also ordered of bottle of sparkling wine to go with dinner. The NY Strip was okay, but I think we could have gotten the same dish elsewhere. The Swordfish was a huge disappointment. Our Pommes Dauphines came out cold and the Asparagus were just fine. The best part of the meal was the dessert. We ordered the chocolate plate which was delicious. We should have had dessert and champagne! For $250.00 this meal was definitely a disappointment in regards to food. However the view was spectacular and the service was good. We received many recommendations from the servers which were very helpful. Would I return? Most likely not. It's not worth the money. We could have had a better meal elsewhere, but we wouldn't have had the view. Then again you can't hear the music from way up there. It was worth doing once, but that's about it.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The fountains were not operating due to the wind but the view from the table was great.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We booked ahead to ensure that they had a seat for us as we wanted to see the Bellagio fountains at sunset while we had dinner. We decided on the tasting menu (degustation) with matching wines. We opted out of the cheese platter on the waiters recommendation but did add the chocolate soufflé. The children were well accommodated. The view was fantastic and service first class. The food was unbelievable. As with everything in the US it was big. A typical degsutation in Australia will give you six small servers, however each of the 'tastings' were a meal in themselves. The wine matching was perfect and we were really looked after and made to feel very special. It toped off a great day.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Our first was a year ago and after that visit we felt the food and atmosphere was excellent. Unfortunately, it was the first high end restaurant we went to on the strip and had nothing to compare it to. This visit the food proved to be bland and uninspiring, the server was often nowhere to be found, and the prices seemed even more extravagant for the portion sizes. For me, I am willing to go to a high price restaurant in Vegas to eat food I could not get anywhere else in an environment like no other. The Eiffel Tower with its great view of the Bellagio fountains and the strip makes it the most romantic restaurant on the strip. However, that’s probably the only reason why you would want to go there. How is the food? Well my wife got the salad for $16 which consisted of a small head of romaine with a light dressing and a large poppy seed "crouton". Romaine for $16? This compared to Michael Mina's (similar classed restaurant at the Bellagio) where a $16 salad gets you a large portion of field greens, high quality blue cheese, walnuts and pear shavings. I ordered the lamb which basically was two lamp chops that were encrusted with something that had no flavor. It was so bad I had to peal it off the meat. It tasted like something I could get for half the price at restaurant back home. All I am saying, if you are going to spend $200 for a dinner for two, there are much better restaurants on the strip. If you want a great view, go visit the bar at the Eiffel Tower and eat somewhere else.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

(One of the few cheaper things on the menu) It had hardly any flavor, I've made better chicken after coming home from a day of work.

It's not the kind of place you would call into just because you were hungry.We booked in advance for 4 people, which meant we had to leave credit card details so they could charge us if we didn't turn up. Upon booking we were asked if it was a special occasion.You go up in an elevator to the restaurant and are greeted and taken to your table. We were given a table which was semi-circular so that we could all be facing the beautiful views of the Bellagio fountains.The food is expensive, but delicious, and you would probably only go here as a one off.It is traditional French cuisine as you would expect. I really wanted to visit the restaurant itself, but wasn't keen on the idea of the French food (stupid I know given that it's an Eiffel Tower restaurant!), but it was easy to find something I liked. I had foie gras ($25) to start, followed by fillet mignon with your choice of sauce ($47) with asparagus and potato gratin.Starters include soups, snails, lobster, salads etc.Mains include various cuts of steak, fish dishes, beef wellington, lamb and vegetarian options.There is also an extensive wine list. The atmosphere is elegant and quiet so you can eat in peace. It would be perfect for a romantic meal, but also nice to dine as a group as well.The service was also good; the waiter was on hand to answer any queries you may have and make suggestions. My friend's steak was not cooked as requested, but the waiter was extremely apologetic and helpful in fetching a new one.I would definitely recommend dining here if you don't mind paying for a nice meal in a beautiful restaurant.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The best part of the restaurant was the bar area and the bar tender Carson. He was a really good conversationalist and gave me plenty of things to see in Vegas that I might have not seen otherwise. He also recommended my sandwich after listening to my preferences for food. He also makes a mean lemonade too!

I took my husband and two friends to dinner at the The Eiffel Tower Restaurant on Jan 29, 2010. Our expectation was to enjoy a gourmet meal with excellent service and a romantic ambiance. These expectations were not met, in any respect. A few observation on our experience:1) The hostess desk is confused. There were a hoard of people attempting to check in, and there was no clear process. The hostesses were not friendly or knowledgeable. The entry was crowded and and shared a noisy space with the bar. It felt more like we were walking into the all you can eat buffet, rather than a fine dining restaurant. The clientelle was also a bit surprising, many were dressed very casually (jeans, etc), definitely setting a different tone than I expected.2) Once we were seated, we waited a good 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledged our table. It was only when I returned to the hostess stand (and yes, that is what it is), was I able to get a waiter to help us.3) The waiter was another story... he was casual and interruptive, often commenting on our private conversation at the table. When asked what he recommended from the menu, he preceeded to list about 20 items. Frankly, it would have been easier to ask him what he didn't recommend. His knowledge of the dishes was lacking, and his style was casual and messy.4) We enjoy good wine, and eagerly reviewed the wine list with the help of the sommelier. However, I find it insulting that when asked for some guidance and suggestion, his first suggestion to my husband, and rather loudly to the table, was a $900 bottle of cab. Now I love a good wine, but I find thatt approach very tacky, and unprofessional. We ultimately chose a $200+ bottle, which semed to please him, until we ordered a $150 bottle later - at which time we defintely were given a cold shoulder by the sommelier. Mind you the mark up on these wines is tremendous, but that is to be expected. What is not to be expected is the poor service that accompanied it. 5) The food - It was good, but certainly not exceptional. The filet mignon was $50+, without any sides. The waiter delivered it all wrong, and the steaks were all mixed up... how hard is it to get an order for 4 correct? The sides were average... nothing to wow you. Over all, lacked originality and style. I have had the items on that menu at many average restaurants around the country, at a far lower price point.6) The ambience is very iffy. If you get a table for 2 at the window, you may be very good, but you will be very crowded as the tables are very close. We, on the other hand, were sitting in the middle of the resaurant, where they somehow believe it is a good idea to put the bussing trays next to the dining tables. So as you eat you get to hear crach, crash, crash of silverware and dirty plates hitting the bussing tray, and enjoy that lovely view. This seemed to be the case for many tables in the resaurant.So-- in the end we paid around $900 for a meal for 4, including 2 bottle of good but not exceptional wine. It was not a good experience, except for the company we shared which was great. I am amazed this place survives - and can only believe that it is due to location and tourist hype. It is NOT worth it!So many truly gourmet resaurants in Vegas... avoid this place. If yo must go up the Tower, have a drink, enjoy the view and leave... Bon appetite!</review><polarity>-1</polarity><confidence>1</confidence></doc>

The two of us ran up a $175 tab..2 martinis and the sea scallops, but since this was a special night out, it could have been way worse.

Have in mind you are also paying for the location and the outstanding view of the Bellagio fountains show right in front of view and from above, just make sure you ask for a table to the Bellagio, otherwise its not worth staying there. Altough the service is great, the waiter tends to be pushy regarding the meals, kind of force you to eat french way making you order all the entrées and having the 18 dollar peach cocktails (which is so bad that I couldnt finish even in the martini glass they served, you can actually see our 2 drinks half full in picture 3). The main dish is always great and the crème bûrlée is real french grade quality, just skip the entré and the pushy cocktails and you will be fine with a much less expensive bill.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

It far exceeded our expecations. The hostess staff were very welcoming and our waitress was helpful, professional and fun. The wine list was impressive- a bit pricey- but our waitress helped us find a half bottle of cabernet for $76 that we really enjoyed. The food was delicious- started with squash and a piece of bread, we both then ordered the filet which was cooked to perfection. We also each ordered a potato side dish that were very good. They knew we were on our honeymoon and brought us a chocolate mousse on the house that was heavenly. We ended with their apple dessert with cinnamon ice cream- the best dessert ever! The tables are a little cramped as people mentioned, but I didn't mind having to snuggle up to my new husband and look out our window view at the fountains bursting in front of The Bellagio! I would go back - it's expensive, but worth the experience.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

I mean really, a restaurant in a replica of the Eiffel Tower. How good could it really be, especially when the restaurant at the REAL Eiffel Tower has bad food and horrible service. But after sitting down to eat I was impressed. The menu options were great. The prices weren't excessive and the wine list was amazing. It was nice, too, that they had wine by the glass list that changed nightly and included some of their best wines; perfect for those of us who might not want to drop $300 on a bottle of wine (or $19,000, the most expensive bottle!). The food tasted great from salad to souffle and the service was also top notch. They also had a live piano player and chanteuse that sounded good. The only down side was the "professional" picture they took of us, which didn't turn out well. Even that, though, they didn't charge us for when they saw that it didn't turn out.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

I made the reservations about a month in advance, and you have to give them a credit card number to hold your reservation. If you don't show up for your reservation, you will each be charged a "no show" fee, so be forewarned. Our reservation was for 8:45pm. We were greeted by the hostesses, all very nice and friendly (I know some of the previous reviewers haven't been so kind). We were given a top notch table for two, right by the window, positioned center stage for the fountains across the street at the Bellagio. We each had a celebratory cocktail ($18 each) and then we each proceeded to have an appetizer, our entree, we shared a side of potatoes, and we split the chocolate dessert. The food was very good, and I would say we had more than enough to eat. I had the rack of lamb, my boyfriend the salmon. The waiter was consistent, but rather business-like. He could have warmed up a little bit and offered more of a personal touch. Our total tab came to $240.00, including a generous tip. I think this is a good location for a special occasion. I don't know if I would go back the next time I'm in Las Vegas, since I like to try new places, and there are so many others to choose from in Vegas, but I would not hesitate to recommend this restaurant to anyone.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We were seated promptly for our 7:45pm reservation at an amazing table offering a perfect view off the Fountains at Bellagio. I don't think there is a better mealtime view of the strip anywhere in Vegas. The view alone is worth it! We ordered freely, trying to let go of the prices and just enjoy the evening, and even in doing so we still only spent a little over $250 for two. Rack of Lamb, Salmon, Scallops to start, Martinis, a side dish each and an incredible melt in your mouth raspberry souffle. The service was fantastic and the atmosphere was unbeatable.

On our way to the restaurant we passed many long long line-ups for other restaurants for their Sunday brunch. We were extremely worried that we would also wind up in a long line up. We arrived at the elevator to take us up to the restaurant and were greated by a very friendly host who took us up personally and showed us the kitchen. For 2 people dining they have dining at the window. We were over-looking the Bellagio fountains and were surprised when they were putting on a show during our brunch - what a nice surprise. The champagne and OJ were overpriced - $28 a glass (very tiny glass) so I was disappointed with that. The food was excellent; I had a cheese souffle and my sister had a salmon egg dish. Both were not filling but very lovely. We would definitely go back there for dinner.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We had a beautiful table by the window overlooking the Bellagio Fountains (make your reservations closer to 6pm – you’ll have a better chance to get the window because they won’t hold them – we got there at 6:15pm) which didn’t hurt the experience AT ALL, but really the food was superb. Service was gracious and the staff in general were very attentive, which is a must in my book. Our waiter Noah (pronounced NO-WAY, he’s from Mexico) recommended the Bleu Cheese Soufflé as a starter - which was delicate and delicious. Seriously, we’re foodies and this was the bomb. We also had the warm shrimp app, but the soufflé was the best. We each started with a Sweet Pea Amuse Bouche (single bite- sized hors d’oevre) which was light and very tasty. My husband had the Roast Duck, and I ordered the New York steak with the Cabernet Reduction – both were mouth watering and cooked to perfection. I wasn’t expecting the steak to be that good, but it was. Only critique here is I wish they offered a smaller portion for the ladies – say 6oz instead of 8oz., or better yet, 5oz. My husband couldn’t stop commenting on the duck – he was very happy!Another thing about this restaurant – the portion sizes are petite (or what they used to be before the restaurant industry started feeding Americans in troughs) which is perfect when you’re eating more than one course, and even with the more manageable portion sizes, we were still too full for dessert.I think I should mention we started with a Chocolate Martini a piece – which really was like having a dessert before dinner. But I don’t regret it – they were best chocolate martini’s we’ve ever had, and I only wish we’d had them after dinner. A note about the breads they serve with dinner – this is not the place to come if you’re watching your carbs. The breads were very French and very perfect. Bread happens to be my weakness, but I have to tell you – a perfect baguette is harder than it sounds. It has to taste like something, along with having just the right crunchy-on-the-outside-light-and-airy-on-the-inside thing going. We could have had just the bread and maybe a hunk of cheese and a couple of glasses of wine a piece and that would have satisfied us – the bread was that good. We ordered a second basket because my husband loves bread even more than I do.Definitely worth a stop here for a special occasion, or if you’re just interested in having a superior meal. (The General Manager of the restaurant made a point of checking in and stopping by every seated table and invited us to call him the next time we were in town -very nice touch).Two Appetizers, two Entrees, two Side Dishes – Spinach and the Potato Au Gratin, two Cocktails and a glass of Zinfandel came to just over $200. Definitely worth it and we will absolutely dine there again.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Reservations are recommended. If you are lucky you get a window seat, but even the seats the furthest back in the restaurant are pleasant. It is not a cheap restaurant, but every meal we have had has been tasty. The filet mignon and the chocolate souffle are our favourites here.

At the top of the Eiffel Tower, your too high, at water level your too low. The restaurant view is perfect. You take the private elevator to the restaurant, walk through the kitchen and there it is….full view of the Bellagio. Great entrance way. You sit down and if your lucky enough (which we were) you sit at the window so that both you and your date and or group have full view of the strip. Your waiter comes by (I cant remember our waiters name, however he was so precise and knowledgeable of the whole menu) and explains the menu and drink specials. Our appetizer was the tomato mozzarella dish which was so tasty. The “special juice” they pour over it dissolves in the mozzarella giving it an amazing taste. I had the beef wellington which was cooked to perfection and my girl friend had the surf and turf. The wellington was so good my gf wanted to come again and order that. Her surf and turf was very good however not the best crab we have ever had. For deserts, their soufflés are unbelievable. Many different flavors any would be great.All in all, (with a Lettuce Entertain You gift card $50) the meal cost roughly $200.00 including tip. It may be a splurge however with a bottle of wine, appetizer, and two great entrees we thought it was well worth the amount. Plus the view adds so much. Would definitely recommend for a one night splurge in Vegas for a romantic evening before or after one of the great shows.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Our plates had a small pool of oil on them. I'm no French cuisine connoisseur, so maybe it was supposed to be oily. I cannot stand paying $5.50 for a soft drink. Service was good. There were several patrons that did not follow the dress code, so it apparently is not a huge issue.I booked here for a romantic lunch with my wife.

On arriving at our booking time we were asked by our maitre de to sit at the bar with a promise that a table would become available shortly. After ordering a drink from a very rude and surly barman -Fifteen minutes transpired and no table was available, I asked the maitre de as to the status. She responded with a insincere smile that a table would be available shortly. A further fifteen minutes later (total 30 mins) no table was available for our party - even though to the naked eye there were plenty of seats unoccupied. Further enquries provided the same response that a table would be available shortly. After this - we gave up. To wait 30 minutes for a table despite booking a table was totally unacceptable.

We had a 6-course chef's tasting menu for $89 pp. Of them, only the Les Amuses Bouche, the roasted leg of lamb entrée, and our desserts (a classic Creme Brulee and a White Chocolate Banana Elysee, were enjoyable. The remaining dishes, vichyssoise, lobster appetizer, red snapper, all missed the mark by a wide margin. The room itself is much too crowded. Every inch of space is used and diners at adjacted tables along the window are almost literally back-to-back. Servers constantly struggling to get by one another in the narrow aisle are a significant distraction. Our primary waiter, however, was quite good, and his wine pairing for the lamb was excellent. Dinner for two, two cocktails, two glasses of wine and tip put us over $300. Definitely not worth it.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

What an lovely experience.We read all about it here on TA and was intrigued. We were helped by the comments here on what to order and to expect. We love fine food and just know what we like when we taste it. We have eaten at a few French restaurants before and knew basically what to expect.We were greeted warmly at the elevators and taken by the kitchen. We were seated at a side by side table for 2 facing the window over looking the Belaggio fountains. Our reservation was at 7:30 and so it did get dark enough for us to enjoy the view at night.Our server was Oscar and I will just say it now, He made the experience so special for us.He was kind and patient and by end of the evening he felt like an old friend.He brought us little cheese puffs to start with that were very good. Then a starter before a starter he called a something? bouche. Those of you that are fine food experts will know what I mean. 3 little tiny dishes on a pretty rectangular plate that is to tease and open up the palate. ( See I was listening Oscar! :) One was a English pea custard, one something with lamb and another salmon. All were very unusual, but surprisingly good. My finance' has never agreed to try salmon or lamb before and he did,(for Oscar!). In the name of this fine dining once in a life time experience!Then time to order, for an appetizer the bleu cheese pudding souffle. As others have said here, it was unusual, but SO rich, SO creamy and very tasty! We shared this dish together. There was also crusty french bread available all evening.We had already decided our entrees before arriving. He ordered the Beef Wellington and I ordered a chicken dish. NO, NO, NO. Oscar said I could not come there and just order chicken, as chicken is just chicken and what can you really do with a chicken? (or something like that.) He talked me into quail. Yes, I who have had quails as pets ate a quail.(I have also had chickens as pets so????) The quail was very good. The sauce that was made with a veal reduction really made it. As you probably know quail is very small, in the name again, of the experience, I ordered it and enjoyed it. I cut it in small pieces and really savored and enjoyed it.It came with a cabbage salad like side dish that also was very good.My finance' absolutely raved about the Beef Wellington. And I tasted it also and it was so good. If you like your meat well done, they are very accommodating about this. Oscar said, that they would cook it as long as they usually do and serve it. Then the diner cuts into it, if it is still to pink then he will take it back to be cooked some more. He did not have to do this. It was perfect! We shared the au gratin potatoes that were good and filling but nothing to rave about.For dessert we ordered the chocolate souffle. I am a chocolate lover and never had one so this was a must for me. If you want souffle it must be ordered at the beginning of the meal so it can be baked the proper amount of time and to be done when we are finished with our entree'. It was superb in every way. So rich and warm and chocolatey. So good. So good.When we thought we were done, Oscar brought out another little complimentary chocolate mousse -type dessert with a french inscription on it. He said from the chef, to help celebrate such a special occasion.We had a half bottle of wine, recommended by Oscar, as we do not know about wine so much. It was perfect! So if you are a little apprehensive about wine, or a dining experience such as this, don't be. The entire staff are there to help and serve you and always made us feel nothing short of royalty.We also had our picture taken by Oscar with our camera. We were asked about the professional one, but had brought our camera per advise from the TA site.He worked with our camera to get the best shots and to have the fountain in the background. They turned out very good. Also, the manager came out and chatted with us about our experience and we were happy to tell him how perfect it had been!What a perfect evening. What a night. What a dinner. What you won't believe? Our bill?Just $171!! For all of this!We highly recommend this wonderful establishment!Warm hellos and wishes to Oscar and good luck on his road races and marathons.With all the little bits of foods and courses, I did not leave hungry.I</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

At the top of the Eiffel Tower, your too high, at water level your too low. The restaurant view is perfect. You take the private elevator to the restaurant, walk through the kitchen and there it is….full view of the Bellagio. Great entrance way. You sit down and if your lucky enough (which we were) you sit at the window so that both you and your date and or group have full view of the strip. Your waiter comes by (I cant remember our waiters name, however he was so precise and knowledgeable of the whole menu) and explains the menu and drink specials. Our appetizer was the tomato mozzarella dish which was so tasty. The “special juice” they pour over it dissolves in the mozzarella giving it an amazing taste. I had the beef wellington which was cooked to perfection and my girl friend had the surf and turf. The wellington was so good my gf wanted to come again and order that. Her surf and turf was very good however not the best crab we have ever had. For deserts, their soufflés are unbelievable. Many different flavors any would be great.All in all, (with a Lettuce Entertain You gift card $50) the meal cost roughly $200.00 including tip. It may be a splurge however with a bottle of wine, appetizer, and two great entrees we thought it was well worth the amount. Plus the view adds so much. Would definitely recommend for a one night splurge in Vegas for a romantic evening before or after one of the great shows.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We arrived about a half hour early and they were able to sit us immediately. We had a table for two right by the Bellagio fountain show. The tables by the window are set so that you each can comfortably watch the show. The view was the best part of lunch. We each had chicken that was deep fried and seemed very oily. Our plates had a small pool of oil on them. I'm no French cuisine connoisseur, so maybe it was supposed to be oily. I cannot stand paying $5.50 for a soft drink. Service was good. There were several patrons that did not follow the dress code, so it apparently is not a huge issue.I booked here for a romantic lunch with my wife. In the end, the view was excellent, but the food was not worth it.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

After been given an afternoon inspection of the restuarant by a friendly attentant with great expectations for a fine night we decided to arrange a booking for that evening. On arriving at our booking time we were asked by our maitre de to sit at the bar with a promise that a table would become available shortly. After ordering a drink from a very rude and surly barman -Fifteen minutes transpired and no table was available, I asked the maitre de as to the status. She responded with a insincere smile that a table would be available shortly. A further fifteen minutes later (total 30 mins) no table was available for our party - even though to the naked eye there were plenty of seats unoccupied. Further enquries provided the same response that a table would be available shortly. After this - we gave up. To wait 30 minutes for a table despite booking a table was totally unacceptable. This restaurant needs to pick up its act at the front end....very dissatisfied.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We went to ET restaurant not expecting to be "wowed" by the food, but we didn't expect it to be so average either. We had a 6-course chef's tasting menu for $89 pp. Of them, only the Les Amuses Bouche, the roasted leg of lamb entrée, and our desserts (a classic Creme Brulee and a White Chocolate Banana Elysee, were enjoyable. The remaining dishes, vichyssoise, lobster appetizer, red snapper, all missed the mark by a wide margin. The room itself is much too crowded. Every inch of space is used and diners at adjacted tables along the window are almost literally back-to-back. Servers constantly struggling to get by one another in the narrow aisle are a significant distraction. Our primary waiter, however, was quite good, and his wine pairing for the lamb was excellent. Dinner for two, two cocktails, two glasses of wine and tip put us over $300. Definitely not worth it.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We were met at the elevator by a very friendly greeter who already knew it was our anniversary which I thought showed a lot of professionalism.After a short wait at the bar we were seated in a window seat with the dozen red roses I had ordered waiting at the table. They unfortunately had run out of the blue cheese souffle ( it was around 10.45pm) and so I had the roasted foie gras which was excellent and my wife had the camembert with almonds which she also really enjoyed. The view of the bellagio fountains was beautiful and at no point did we feel rushed during the meal.Our server, a french chap who was apparently celebrating his 40th anniversary soon and had married his wife just across the road made us feel hugely welcome, took a real interest in us, and was more than happy to take some pictures.Our main courses of rack of lamb and the vegetarian option (can't remember exact meal) were also very well prepared, and we shared a chocolate souffle for desert ( Please note these take 1/2hr to prepare so you need to order at the start of the meal). To finish the meal we were presented with a complimentary desert wishing us a happy anniversary which was very thoughtful and a lovely touch.All in all with a decent bottle of wine ($65) and the roses ($55) the bill came to $280.00 before tip and whilst this is a lot of money I felt that the sense of occasion and surroundings for a special evening warranted it. Highly recommended.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

However, you can get a fabulous lunch menu with the same great view, service, and attention to detail at a decent price.We made reservations on a Sunday for lunch on Monday. Reservations are a snap. You can call, or just make them at the elevator for the Eiffel Tower.The lunch menu has all the wine selection as dinner. The menu is mostly sandwiches and salads.The wait staff was very helpful. I don't claim to be overly sophisticated when it comes to fine French dining. If I didn't know the proper etiquette or what food was placed in front of me, I asked. The waiter did not seem annoyed in the least, and was both patient and helpful.I ordered the lamb burger. When I was asked how I wanted it prepared, I told the waiter I had never had lamb before, and asked what he recommended. I took his advice, and my meal was wonderful. The lamb was served with potatoe chips. At first I thought that was weird until I realized they weren't from a bag. They were FRESH.The lunch lasted about an hour and a half. This isn't a restaurant for those in a hurry. The food is timely, but not rushed. The portions are not huge, but rich and surprisingly filling. The ambience and view from the restaurant was breathtaking. After a morning of chaos walking down the Strip, I thought I had died and gone to heaven.Lunch, including wine and dessert was $88. This did not include tip.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Charming man on the lift door(Kevin?) said it was no problem that I didn't have a reservation. Arrived at the restaurant and was greeted? by 2 surly hostesses who, without even looking up at me, told me a table would be an hour. I said I would wait at the bar. After more than an hour I approached the hostesses again only to be told that they had looked for me at the bar but didn't recognise me as I had removed my cardigan!! I neither saw or heard them look for me at a small bar area. Was lead to worse table totally on my own, boxed in with glass and could only observe all other diners enjoying themselves in the main dining area. Had to wait 25 mins for a glass of wine. Food was cold when it arrived. This is the first time in my life I have not left a tip. I was made to feel like a second class citizen. Complained and the manager was mortified. He asked me to return for lunch the next day but I was so humiliated i declined. An awful way to treat a paying customer.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

So word of advise: if you are trying to take someone to a surprise dinner, reserve at least a day or two in advance as this place is quite popular!Once we arrived there was a private elevator that takes you up to the restaurant. When at the top we were greeted by a friendly host who guided us by the kitchen and to the main restaurant area. We were a bit early so they gave us a nice seat in the bar area to have a drink. Even though we had yet to get to our seats, we could already see the great view of the Bellagio fountains from the bar. The bar waitress was very nice and extremely pleasant. Within minutes our table was ready and we were taken to a table right in front of the window overlooking the strip/bellagio fountains. The scenery alone was worth going!The food itself was all really good. I ordered the rack of lamb and it was probably the best I have ever had. We also started with a raw beef appetizer which was amazing and through the meal a server would offer us baguette and other buns throughout each course. For dessert we shared a chocolate souffle which was amazing. At the end since they knew it was our anniversary they even presented us with a special custard/pudding to share which was a nice touch.Overall it was a great experience. The food prices were a bit high, but keep in mind you are paying for a unique experience. Also the service was great, I have read previous reviews that complained about the speed, but keep in mind this isn't Applebee's. Everything is prepared from scratch and is a fine dinning experience. With the great view I don't know why anyone would be in a rush to leave. If you are simply looking for any place to eat, this place may not be your best bet, but if you are looking for a unique and romantic environment, it's gotta be one of the best options in Vegas!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Best restaurant view in Vegas but experience is almost completely ruined by agonizingly slow service and mediocre food. Seated 30 minutes late on a Sunday night, then it was another 60 minutes before the main course arrived and then another 20 minutes before dessert. 2 full hours for soup/dinner/dessert is unacceptable. On top of that, the food was OK at best and certainly not close to dazzling French as one would hope. Kitchen staff should all be fired and a team with some cooking and timing talent should be hired. As everyone else said, go for the view only and expect to be gouged for the pleasure of watching the Bellagio fountain shows. There are many other better dining choices in Vegas that will leave you broke but at least satisfied.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

I made a reservation online and requested a table overlooking for fountains. I was pleasantly surprised to see that our request was granted. The table is placed against the window with two chairs side-by-side sharing the view. I appreciated the intimate set up. Our waiter was wonderful – helpful in selecting items and not at all intimidating. We started with a blue cheese soufflé appetizer that literally melted in my mouth. I chose the duck and husband had the rabbit. Both were excellent and of good proportion. We had also ordered a side of au gratin potatoes and didn’t really need them. For dessert we shared a Grand Marnier soufflé and it was very tasty. Throughout dinner we were able to watch the beautiful Bellagio water show every twenty minutes or so. It was a spectacular view. It was a very special dinner.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The food was good, the portions were a lil small for me(I'm a normal size guy). but usually french restaurants have smaller portions. You have to order the souffle(spelling??) it was the best i ever had. of course arrive early cause you have to get thru casino crowd and parking, then wait to take elevator up to reastaurant, which depending on traffic can take awhile.

What your going to get for your money is a beautiful view of the Bellagio Fountains (ask for this in your reservation though), a very polite staff prepared with knowledge of the wines and food served, and a creatively prepared dish. What your also going to get is a pretty hefty check, and most likely a rumbling stomach 2 hours later, since we all know fine dining is notorious for having small servings. When I made the reservation, they offer a photo taken for 26 dollars. I only did this since it was my husband's 30th, and I figured they wouldn't use my camera if they specifically offer a paid photo service. Kinda sucked when I saw the couple next to me getting their picture being taken by the waiter with their own digital camera.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We dined at a few finer restaurants on the strip, but I have to say the Eiffel Tower Restaurant was overall the best. The hostesses were very courteous and chatty. We were able to get a table overlooking the Bellagio Fountains. We arrived at 5:30 on a Thursday. There was a lot of people there, but it wasn't what I would call 'busy,' which made it very easy to get any table we wanted. If you plan on getting a good view of the fountains, I recommend reserving your table before 6:30-7pm. Anyways, our waiter, I think his name was Igor, was very good. He was conversational, but didn't talk too much so my wife and I could enjoy each others company and the fountain show. We aren't big on appetizers, and at a restaurant like this where some servers almost expect you to order a 4-course meal (See my less than stellar review of The Mix at Mandalay Bay), the waiter was not pushy about adding things to the bill. The food was great. We ordered the 'Eiffel Tower Chocolate Plate' for dessert. It was amazing. If you love chocolate, you have to order this. At the end of our meal Igor brought out a small 'happy birthday' dessert for my wife. It was much appreciated. The best thing, however, about our experience was a short conversation we had with someone I believe was a manager, as we were waiting for our elevator. She asked us "what do you think it means to provide good service." I was blown away. This restaurant actually cares about improving customer service, with ACTUAL customer feedback. You know how in most restaurants, you get the lame manager that comes around and asks every table, as if they care, "how is everything?" You say "great" and they keep walking. The fact that this particular manager asked a carefully crafted question in order to get feedback that will help them serve people better tells me this restaurant is always going to be one of the premier spots to dine on the strip.First-class, First-rate restaurant. Highly recommend.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The food was great, the view was great, and the restaurant gave us a free dessert for our anniversary that was done up very well. The only thing we didn't like about it, was that it was not intimate. The environment was pretty loud for a place like this. Most everyone was dressed very well, but you did have those who walked came in wearing clothes that I would say are not appropriate for this restaurant. I believe they had a dress code, but it wasn't enforced. We did enjoy this, but it could have been better.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

My partner asked her for a window table and she took us to this great table a little out of the way to the side with a fabulous view of the fountain. To be honest the whole night is a bit of a blur as my partner proposed to me.

Had a great window view of the Bellagio (just what we ask for on Open Table when reserving). It was a very busy night! Our waiter was very nice but only see him a few times throughout our dinner. We ordered escargot and foie gras with fig compote for appetizers..it was great! It was my first time trying foie gras, it was different but good. My husband had the rack of lamb, which was awesome. My venison loin was pretty good even though we had better. The pistachio souffle was awesome! I also had their pear martini, which I really enjoyed (18 bucks for the drink though!) My husband was already drunk by the time we had dinner so he didn't order any cocktails (he spent many hours at the casino...hehehe). So for 1 drink, 2 appetizers, 2 veggie sides, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert, $210, not bad I thought. It was a wonderful birthday dinner, even though they didn't give me a special bday plate for my dessert. Oh well, still had a great time.

I'll break my review up into categories to hopefully answer specific questions about the place. Food: 4 Stars. The food was very good. I didn't consider it to be memorable; not one of those meals with a "wow factor" but very good nonetheless. The menu is very diverse and even if one isn't into French food I think you'd be able to find something.Service: 5 Stars. Fast, attentive, and friendly. No complaints at all. Value: 3 Stars. It's expensive but I don't think that is news to anyone. I'd consider there to be a 20-25% markup from a similar restaurant that isn't in Vegas or in a faux Eiffel Tower. Is it worth it in light of the superior service and view? Probably yes IMO but I could see how some might be put off. Atmosphere: 3.5 Stars. The restaurant was a lot busier than I expected. There are a lot of tables and quite a bit of activity going on everywhere. It's really an impressive operation; they serve a lot of tables in a fast and efficient manner. What's good about the place is the view; regardless of where your table is you'll have a great view of the Strip. What's not as good is those coming in looking for a quiet, romantic, leisurely meal will probably be a bit dissapointed. Then again, we were there at 8 on a Saturday night so maybe other times are a bit more subdued. The beautiful decor and great view scream "quiet and romantic" but the atmosphere is more along the lines of "elegant, well-attended dinner party"All in all a great restaurant; I'm glad we had opportunity to try it. I'd recommend it to friends with the above caveats.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

So you see my review is mixed just like life..The real Jules Verne at the real top of the Eiffel has an incredible view that is almost worth the price. The food there is better than good and the price is about 3 times as much as Vegas. However, you get to remember and talk about it for the rest of your life.

He had mentionned upon making reservations that it was my birthday. We had a wonderful table with a view on the Fountains at the Bellagio, the Paris Hotel being just the other side of the street from them. Food and service were expensive but wonderful, and I received a Chocolate Mousse for desert in a nice plate with Happy Birthday. Everything we took was very good. The only thing that surprised us a bit, our maternal tongue being French, is that in a French restaurant, in the Paris Hotel, so many French mistakes were made on the menu! The chef should take 5 minutes and read everything over! The restrooms were perfect.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

I booked the dinner weeks in advance and had requested a table with a view and mentioned to the staff that we were going to be celebrating our recent wedding. Although they were not able to guarantee a table with a view they said that they would try. And my goodness we got THE BEST table. Right infront of the Bellagio Fountains- it was ridiculously romantic. Also, they had sprinkled rose petals on the table to make it even more intimate.Now onto the food. DIVINE. We both had the Beef Wellington which was perfectly cooked with a rich red wine gravy. Its the exact type of food you want to eat when you go out- something that tastes so good you know you could never make it yourself! For desert we shared the pistaschio souffle which we ended up getting free as they said they had kept us waiting for it for too long. To be honest we never noticed! We were too busy watching the fountains!Any way, I agree that it is a bit pricey, but this is the kind of place you really should go to for a special occasion.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

I arrived on time for a reservation made weeks before, half an hour passed and we were still not seated, we were about to leave when the matrie'd came over to seat us and then she had the audacity to hang around for a tip, ill give her one "if people book a table for 7.45, then damn well seat them at 7.45 and not 8.20".The server was excellent, very patient, in fact he was the best thing about the place. My husband and i had the chef's tasting menu. 6 courses, all well spaced out, portions average, everything explained when it was bought. I'll be honest never eaten french food before and can't say i cared for it, the first 3 courses all tasted the same to me, like they had the same common ingredient, something vinegar like (i didn't much care for it).Dessert was excellent, we had creme brule and souffle, you had to order at the start which was OK as we were having the set menu, but even people ordering normally we asked to order a dessert at the start if they wanted one - who knows at that stage...View excellent, service very good, food i don't know, neither of us were amazed by it and i thought i should be for the $270 it came to. Wine was $16 a glass, i nearly fell off my chair.I suppose i expect that the food should have been better for the price.I would not go back, i'd eat somewhere else next time as i didnt feel it was worth the money.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The view is spectacular and it overlooks the Bellagio hotel. We had one of the best servers I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. I didn't catch his name, but he actually immigrated over from the south of France 4 years ago. It was too surreal, dining on fine french cuisine with a server with a french accent! We ate during lunchtime, and I had the chicken sandwich. Very rich, and very good. My husband had the parmesan chicken filet. The best part was before we left we were offered some chocolate ganache coated with powdered sugar. To die for!!!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

For two people you should expect to spend at least $200. We had dinner at the restaurant back in late September. We had a Window seat looking at the Bellagio fountains across the street. The window table was a bit smaller than interior tables but the view was absolutely worth it. Our waiter took a while to stop by initially but through the rest of the dinner he did an excellent job. The food and wine were fantastic and we never felt forced ordering. Overall, it was a delightful dinner that took about 2 hours which I feel was appropriate to space out the courses. I highly recommend this restaurant for a romantic and relaxing dinner.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Have had many excellent dining experiences in Las Vegas - but this was not one of them. While food was fine with respect to taste and presentation the greatest problem was the environment. You are packed tightly into this space and this was by far the noisiest restaurant we have ever experienced. We could not hold a normal conversation and left early since members of our group were uncomfortable due to the noise. We were surprised when our server openly indicated that the restaurant was always very loud - and that it could get much worse than that night (hard to imagine). In addition, the traffic of people moving by the table was constant (this was the case for most of the tables due to the design of the restaurant). If you wish to enjoy fine dining where the food AND the environment warrant the high expense then look elsewhere in Las Vegas - there are many other options where you won’t be disappointed. If you are convinced that you want to try the food at Eiffel Tower Restaurant – then see if you can get take-out and sit out on Las Vegas Blvd near the Bellagio Fountains – you are likely to enjoy it more than sitting in the restaurant.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The sunset view was magnificent and the fountain show really added to the romantic experience. We were taken to the restaurant from a specialty elevator that arrives in the kitchen. We were escorted to the table on arrival and greeted by our waiter and sommelier, both friendly and knowledgeable. They have an enormous selection of French wine and even had several bottles from St. Emilion, our favorite region. There is plenty of American wine on the menu as well for those that prefer it, but our area is sadly lacking in French importers and distributors so we took advantage of the selection and overpaid for a bottle from Château Figeac.My husband started with the cold foie gras with duck prosciutto and fig compote while I opted for the almond dusted sea scallops with potato galette and tarragon. After an in depth discussion with our server, he chose the roasted rack of lamb with tarragon jus over the rabbit loin, and I passed on the veal medallions in favor of the duck two ways with wild rice, braised turnips, and sauce aigre doux. Duck leg fried in duck fat with medium-rare, crispy duck breast - my mouth waters even now as I am writing about it! We made the mistake of ordering sauteed mushrooms and garlic spinach - they were delicious, but we could not manage more than a couple of bites as the appetizer and dinner portions were so generous. Of course, that did not stop us from ordering the chocolate souffle or sampling from the array of petit fours that came with the bill. The ticket came to just under $300 with tip and we felt the 2-hour experience was well worth the price. Since the file size is too large, we posted photos of the food and the view on fredphoto.net. The service was impeccable and we found the entire atmosphere romantic, but keep in mind that this is a European set up and thus tables are much closer together than the typical American may be used to. You can have a quiet conversation amidst the din of the restaurant, but you will be seated nearly back-to-back with another patron if you have a window seat. Circular platform booths are also available but the view is not as spectacular. We generally like to pick different places each time we eat in Vegas, but it would be hard to resist the temptation to dine here again. The wine, the food, the service - all were a foodie 5 star.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

And enough not like most upper class restaurants where you usually leave hungry after a nice meal...Finally the dessert: You must try the souflle'. Its heavenly! They are known for the best souffle' in town but YOU MUST try it. I could come back just for the dessert only :-)Because it was my Birthday, I received a little extra dessert with a nice Birthday decoration. Very thoughtful.Everything was just perfect.

Our first dinner there a year ago was very good.Upon arriving, we were told that we were to wait for one of their better tables to open up, because "people with reservations get the better tables. " We sat at the bar with some champagne when the hostess came over, put our champagne on a tray and escorted us over to our beautiful view of Bally's?!!!!! Once I saw the "view" I told the hostess that we would rather wait for a better table. She said we could wait. In a weird move, she then handed us back our champagne and bolted back to the front desk. Kind of an awkward moment. When we walked back past the hostess desk, I mentioned to her that "I don't think that was really one of your 'better' tables." She said, I'm sorry you don't think so, we think it is! Kind of a little inappropriate attitude in my opinion. Afterall, service is all about making the customer happy!We were shortly thereafter, seated at a beautiful table overlooking the Fountains of the Bellagio. Our waiter deserves special note as one of the finest waiters we have ever had the pleasure to serve us. His name is David Brouillet. David quickly had us forget the opening awkward moment with the hostess. He made the night. His service, recommendations, attitude, personality and professionalism were superb. Just an absolute joy to have had him as our waiter.The food at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant is very good. It is not over the top good like some other high end restaurants, but very good food and wonderful view make it a great choice of restaurant.I had a phenomenal cream of asparagus soup! This soup was over-the-top good! As entrees, I had the Chilean sea bass served with olive oil, garlic and spinach (which I thought was very good), my wife had filet mignon with sauce bearnaise (also very good). We also shared a decadent potata au gratin (too good!) We had a wonderful grand marnier souffle as dessert.We were treated to a chocalate mousse to celebrate a special event. And then we were treated to an assortment of homemade candies that were to die for (and I'm not a big candy eater!)The Sommelier (John(?) from Buffalo listened to my requests and recommended an incredible wine from Chateauneuf-de-Pape. (2005 - Telegraph). This wine was incredible! (we are members of 5 Napa wine clubs drink lots of wine). Great recommendation and interesting facts about the wine and the region. Well done!One negative...a bathroom attendant! I never like seeing an attendant in a bathroom. Feeling the need to pay (tip) to go to the bathroom irks me. I wound up standing in a puddle of urine which had not been mopped up only to feel the need to tip the attendant after being handed a paper towel! What purpose does a bathroom attendant serve? To hand me a towel and collect a couple of bucks for handing it to me! I will eat at the Eiffel Tower restaurant again. I will request David Brouillet as our "captain/"</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Our party of 6 enjoyed only the view of top of the buildings across the street - :( couldn't see Bellagio Fountains. The arrival on the elevator is a bit different delivering you into the "kitchen"? The hostesses are extremely friendly and accommodating. They definitely DO NOT enforce any kind of dress code. We had the men in our group wear the suggested jacket only to find others wearing jeans and tennis shoes. It takes away from the "fanciness" of the place.Our waiter although nice was lacking personality and friendliness. I found the menu to be a bit over priced, especially after my meal. This is where I found the problem: the food for most of our group arrived lukewarm, which to me is the ultimate sin!!! My red snapper was just ok and a bit salty. It sat on a bed of greens with onions which tasted like basic sauteed spinach. The potatoes gratin were EXTREMELY salty -- I informed the server which he graciously informed me he would tell the Chef and take off the bill. He may have told the Chef but it was definitely on the bill. The side dishes were not impressive asparagus, mushrooms, potatoes (and again cold). We ordered a raspberry souffle, we got the wrong one too, we ate it as it takes 1/2 hr to prepare another one.All in all it was just an OK meal and based on our experience and for the price I don't think I would recommend it nor return. Maybe others have had better luck, unfortunately for us (and them too) it did not leave us saying "oh la la".</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The view to the fountains was incredible. However, the "dress code" they supposedly have is not enforced. Some people were wearing casual clothes. We also made our reservation month in advance, but had to wait nearly an hour past our reservation time to be seated. Once seated it took 30 min to get our order in, but once we started eating the staff were quick to stick their hands in front of our faces to take plates off the table even when we werent done with the food. It was evident that the staff were more concerned with how fast they could get us out of there. To make matters worse the food was mediocre, as my girlfriend commented on how the scallops tasted like "something you could find at McDonalds"!!!... since all you could taste was the grease. The other entrees were not impressive at all for $50/plate. Everything was over seasoned. Best of all they forgot some of our order, yet kept it on the bill. Thankfully, it was removed.As for the horderve when you reach the top of the elevator as some people have mentioned... Im still waiting for mine..</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The view of the fountains of the Bellagio across the street provided a continuously entertaining sight. Service was prompt and friendly but we felt we were being rushed along; it was not a relaxing evening. Our party selected a variety of appetizers and entrees and we ordered several different souffles which we were asked about at the beginning of the meal (with no indication of price) and we were not given any information about the other desserts available. We therefore ended up being asked to make hasty choices for our desserts.The appetizers, entrees and souffles were all very ordinary in quality, not at all what I had expected for a restaurant that our friend had recommended (but she does unfortunately live in a town that has little choice of good quality restaurants). In our experience it's unusual to have a dinner where all the courses turn out to be unexciting but that was our experience. Our bill, about $100. each, contained a charge for wine that two of us had already paid for at the bar. We did not notice this at the time and paid the full bill; when we spoke to a manager later and asked for a correction she basically said too bad, she couldn't (or wouldn't) do anything about it. Since the staff knew the bar bill had already been paid we all felt this was probably not an accident and rather a deliberate effort to overcharge.Overall, I don't have good memories of our evening at this restaurant and needless to say would not return. Our dining experiences at other Las Vegas restaurants (for example, in the Venetian hotel) have been very enjoyable.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

It was fabulous - from the food to the service to the view. The restaurant on the 11th floor of the tower, looks out on the Bellagio fountains. You step off the elevator and are greeted in the kitchen with a small hor deuvre served from a silver platter. Everyone greeted you with a smile while being shown to your table. The lunch steak sandwich was the best I have ever had and not badly priced at $15. The portion, served with a small salad and homemade potato chips, was large and could easily be shared. Creme brulee for dessert topped of the experience. Will definitely go back and experience dinner at this place. If you don't want to spend the $ for lunch or dinner, at least have a cocktail in the bar while watching the Bellagio fountains!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We arrived a little too early, so weren't expecting our table to be ready and were directed to the bar where we enjoyed a cocktail. At our booked time the hostess showed us to our table - we got a window seat overlooking the Bellagio fountains - it was a fabulous view!The waiting staff were very attentive and the sommelier was extremely helpful. I had warm shrimp salad to start and my husband had foie gras, we both had venison for entree and souffles for desert. The souffles are amazing!!! This was a birthday treat and I didn't see how much the bill was, so can't comment on value for money - but overall with the view, the service and the food it was a very special evening.Just a couple of comments - we were given a wine list and asked to chose our wine and then we were given a menu, whereas in England we are used to selecting our food and then chosing our wine to compliment our meal - I thought this was slightly odd. Also, I thought I had read somewhere that gentlemen are expected to wear a jacket/business casual attire, so was slightly disappointed that there were people dressed casually in jeans and t-shirts. Neither of these points distracted from a wonderful evening.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

But lunch was very bad. I could hardly eat my lunch it was dripping in grease. The waiter was distressed that we were not eating but it was positively gross. Alsom If you are lactose intolerent this is a tuff place to eat because they want to put cheese on everything! Just think twice before you go. Our bill was $80 for lunch which did not include anything other then an appetizer, 2 lunches and 2 sodas (that is right not even a realy drink on that bill).</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We were greeted at the elevator and brought to the hostess stand where we were told our table would be a bit and were directed to the bar. We each got a drink and were brought to our table about 30 mins later. We were in no rush so the window seat overlooking the Bellagio fountains was great. Our server seemed busy and didn't even acknowledge us for a good 10 mins. When he did arrive he seemed a bit brash. He was very hurried the entire meal and not attentive whatsoever. The sommelier was helpful but chose a wine a bit too light for our palates almost "playing it safe". Our dinners were acceptable for the standards I had put upon the restaurant. I ordered the foie gras which was cooked perfectly but overwhlemed by the fig "compote" sauce. My husband ordered the beef carpaccio which was average. We split the greens with beets which was totally opposite and very lackluster in flavor. I ordered the "surf and turf" if that's what it should be called. It was a petit filet cooked to my medium asking temp and topped off with lump crab meat and again overwhelmed by the sauce. My husband ordered the beef wellington which was consumed by the pastry which became soggy. We didn't order sides as there were none that were very appealing. By this time we skipped dessert and ordered cocktails, I a B-52 on the rocks and my husband a tocai and espresso which was brought out cold and a tuaca instead. We had to flag down our server to correct the mistake who said he brought the correct drink, but then returned knowing he didn't. My husband and I both work at 5 star establishments and I don't think this was worth the visit. There are many other great choices and I wish I had crossed this off the list. Worth having a drink at the bar, but then MOVE ON. It's a definite tourist trap and doesn't appreciate fine food!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The view was incredible, our waiter was very attentive and the food was excellent. However, our evening and those at the tables near ours were ruined by the boor at the next table who insisted on shouting everything he had to say. He had a high opinion of himself as evidenced by all his witty stories about his sales prowess. His stories were peppered with profanity.Our waiter was aware of the problem as he apologized to me during our meal. Unfortunately, the management did nothing about this man's loutish behavior. I spoke to our waiter after our meal to emphasize how disappointed we were management had not intervened. He told me the restaurant's manager said there was nothing he could do about the problem. I asked to speak to the manager. I told him how disappointed we were. He said he was not aware of the problem. Either he or the waiter was lying.Needless to say we were disappointed an otherwise fine evening was ruined.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The restaurant is mediocre at best and all you are paying for is the location view. I took my girlfriend here for her birthday. While we were waiting for our table a lady asked if we would like a drink. My girlfriend said she would like a water. It never came, and the server continued to ask/bring drinks for other waiting customers while she passed us over. Not a big deal, but it seemed intentional and started things out on the wrong foot.The view was excellent and the service was good. That's where it ends. I had the lamb chops which were very bland. My girlfriend had the chicken which was also bland and had skin on, which she had to cut off. We also had mashed potatoes and spinach, both of which had little flavor. The mashed potatoes had no texture or flavor, and if I didn't know better I would say they were of the instant variety out of a box. The bill ended up being $150, which I don't mind paying for a quality meal. The food at the Paris buffet is far, far better.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Great views for looking at while you have your meal. Service is ok.My experience with the food was not a good one. I had lunch there with others and they all agree it was just ok. I am not a food critic at all nor am I a picky eater, but I ended up sending my seafood salad back as the shrimp and crab I had did not taste good and when I smelt it, it sent alarm bells off in my head. I understand we are in the middle of the Nevada dessert but I can buy frozen seafood from the super market that taste and smelt better than that! The chef said he did not find anything wrong with the smell of it though!! Unbelievable ! I would have had trouble feeding it to my cat! He obviously has had some nasel surgery in the last few weeks if he thought that it was acceptable. I was offered other food but declined as if the chef could not pick a problem with what I already sent back to the kitchen, I was not going to trust anything else. Not to mention this was the most expensive lunch dish, yet still just a salad.Very poor quality control. Would have sooner eaten a big mac , and I am not a fan of McDonalds! Would definitely not give them repeat business. Truly not a good French restauraunt as the name and written information would suggest. I hope I am not running to the bathroom all night!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

While on time, the place was packed and we were asked to wait at the bar. $24 for 2 cocktails...I can see why our table "wasn't ready". Meanwhile, everyone (elevator operator, maitre'd, and hostesses) was very polite and went out of their way to escort us around the greeting and bar areas. Once seated, we were greeted by one of the best waiters I have ever encountered, Daniel. If you get him serving your table, consider yourselves lucky. He was extremely polite and well-spoken and plesantly described in detail almost everything that came to our table. I'm not usually one for extra attention, but he was just SO good. While it is a fast paced environment, we never felt hurried and all the servers were very polite. We ordered the tasting menu, which started arriving shortly after ordering. It was all very tasty and high quality. A top 10 meal for me. Unfortunately, right after the meal began my fiance began having severe indigestion. This had been an ongoing problem throughout the trip, so I don't blame ETR's food. We got through the halibut together when she couldn't go any further. This is where this place really shined for us. This was my first trip to Vegas so my fiance wouldn't have us leaving early. Not only did they offer to bag all of my fiances remaining courses (which of course would have been somewhat ridiclous, but it was nice of them to offer), but when we asked them to stop bringing her dishes, they did so graciously and...when the bill came, her food was no where to be seen. We didn't even ask and I was actually expecting to at least pay for something! Additionally, while my fiance was feeling ill the manager came over to check on her numerous times and even went to check on her in the bathroom! Way above and beyond! And the whole time their concern was so sincere and consistent. I really just can't say enough about our experience at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant. Oh yeah, and the view is amazing. Most couples are seated along the windows, so that's a great plus. I would definitely return, but probably not for a while with all of the options in Vegas.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We reserved a table at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant 2 weeks in advance asking for a spectacular table to celebrate an anniversary. The table was spectacular and the food was very good. The service was a bit spotty only because so many levels of waiters served the table. We chose the Tasting Menu - a very good deal for the price. Much of the food needed an explanation and only occasionally did the waiter/waitress provide it. Overall the food and service was good. We won't be going back because the atmosphere did not live up to the multi-star rating. Our expectations of the restaurant ambiance were very high, since we had called the restaurant to change our reservations and overheard the maitre de offering a jacket to a guest. We assumed this meant "jacket required" and all that implies. It didn't. As Vegas veterans, we understand that the old Vegas, where very expensive meals required nice dress and provided an elegant setting are not always the norm! . In an effort to cater to tourist who want to eat in shorts, tennis shoes, jeans and fanny packs, the Eiffel Tower Restaurant feels terribly overpriced and awkward. Go if you don't mind paying at least 300 for a meal with a great view and don't forget your fanny pack!! Finally, a word to the wise, a Martini and Bloody Mary at the bar cost 28.00 - a bit steep for two drinks that were only so-so and a bartender who didn't seem to like his job...</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We had many excellent restaurants in LV to choose from and we both agree we chose wisely. Over the course of a two hour meal we enjoyed excellent food, excellent service, and an excellent view of the fountains (as requested), the mountains and the strip. Service was always available but never intrusive and we enjoyed the quiet atmosphere which allowed us to converse with little effort. Be sure to try the rasperry napolean for dessert!!Total bill was around $180.

The view from the restaurant is absolutely incredible and we were seated facing the Bellagio and were able to watch the fountain show all through our meal. The wait staff is what I would expect from a fine dining restaurant. They were very attentive and provided us with excellent service. I am always surprised to hear people complain about service at these places when I know firsthand that the wait staff are very good and I have to wonder if these people are just rude people who treat waiters badly. We both ordered the blue cheese souffle for appetizers and it was excellent, light as a cloud. Husband ordered the beef Wellington and I ordered the vegetarian crepe. I was pleasantly surprised to find that they had a mini vegetarian section on the menu with a lovely French dish. A few more vegetarian appetizers would be nice though! Our entrees were very tasty and were surprisingly large portion sizes. I had the banana souffle for dessert, my husband had the apple strudel and we also had the cheese plate. The cheese plate would be better if we could pick our own cheeses from a selection but my souffle was absolutely heavenly. Our lovely waiter added chocolate sauce and vanilla creme to mine since I couldn't decide between the chocolate and banana souffles. We had a very romantic meal and paid approximetely $200 for it without any alcohol since we don't drink. Come eat here if you are looking for a posh, romantic meal. Don't bring your kids though, it's not a kid environment.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

They are not interested in repeat customers. From the maitre d' to the manager. No one is interested in whether you are satisfied with the food or service. Their main interest seems to be how many tables they can turn around as fast as possible. Waiters rushing you to order, trying to get you to place a dessert order with your dinner order. Slamming dishes and drawers and swiping dishes off the table as they sprint by.We ordered a bottle of our favorite wine and the wine steward poured us each a glass and then took the bottle half way across the room and put it in a ice bucket where we didn't have access to it. We had to ask the waiter to get OUR wine and had to insist that he leave it on our table so that we could insure WE were the only diners getting to enjoy it. (it was not a cheap bottle of wine by any means) He seemed upset that we wanted the wine we were paying for. This restaurant is just another ridiculous "tourist trap".

I was nervous because the reviews seemed mixed, but everything was great! We had a 6:00 reservation, but we were running late (long, irrelevant story!), so we called at 5:50 to tell them we would be there about 10-15 minutes late. They were very kind about it when we finally arrived and immediately showed us to a table - a great couples table overlooking the Bellagio fountains! We had 7:30 tickets to "O" at Bellagio (see review for that as well!) and as we were running late, we immediately told our waiter. He was not at all fussy about it, just told us he'd get us out of there in time. So we ordered quickly, and the food was brought out in great time. It wasn't the leisurely, slow meal we had hoped for, but still great timing considering our situation. We both had the filet mignon as our main course, which was quite tasty. We even had time to enjoy a wonderful souffle - definitely get the chocolate souffle here! So good! I would also recommend a port with the souffle. We asked the waiter to pick for us, and he picked a great one! Again - we thoroughly enjoyed our experience and arrived at the show just in time! My husband and I are 26/24 respectively and just normal, middle class people, so I was concerned about the reviews I read about stuffy waiters and staff - but that was not our experience! Try this place out if you want a nice, romantic dinner that is unique to the strip because of the cool Bellagio view!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The food was very good. My huband ordered the Roasted Rack of Lamb w/Tarragon Jus and I had the Baked Atlantic Salmon w/ Champagne, Ginger and Brown Butter, with asparagus sprinkled with parmesan cheese and potatoes au gratin. We accompanied our meal with two glasses of fine wine and we had the Grand Marnier souffle and two coffees for dessert, all for under $200 including tip. We did not want to spend our whole budget in one restaurant, plus we had made reservations in various restaurants throughout our stay. The "Sampler Menu" must be ordered by two people and you must like to eat meat as well. I do not eat meat so this would not have worked for me. Table 56 is the nicest table in our opinion, the Bellagio Fountains have spectacular performances throughout your meal, it is an added touch. Enjoy!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We were not disappointed. Don't make the mistake in thinking that seven courses are way too much to eat. Each course is a smaller version of their regular entree items and the dinner is well paced by the attentive wait staff. The wine pairings were outstanding as expected. Very nice room with terrific views of the Strip and Bellagio fountains. Yes, it is expensive. Over $400 for the two of us, but the casino was comping the dinner. Highly recommended!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

They gave us a nice corner booth, but I would have preferred a better view of the Bellagio fountains. It was very hot in the restaurant. My husband and my dad had to take off their sportcoats to cool down. The food quality was excellent, but the fish dishes are way overpriced. The filet mignon was awesome, and was a large portion. Two of us had fish entrees which were good, but not worth what we paid ($35 for halibut). If I ever go back I would definitely order the filet mignon or the veal, since those were much better values for the price.The souffle for dessert was great, and they brought another dessert on the house for my mom's birthday. Service was inpeccable!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

I got the filet mingon with mashed pottoes and my girlfriend got the veal, both were excellent. The souffle was good, but not the greatest ever. The service was great from the moment we stepped in and since we had reservations (through [--]) and arrived a little bit early, we were seated right away. As requested, we were seated at a table next to the window with a great view of the Bellagio. Our waiter was fantastic and made our meal even better with his personality.I'm not really used to spending an upwards of $75 a head at dinner, but in no way do I feel ripped off or taken advantage of. Going into dinner I knew it would be expensive. I think people who complain fail to realize that with the price of the food (while it tasted great, the portions were a little small) you are also paying for the atmosphere and location in which this restaurant is one of a kind.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We wanted something special and got it! We made a reservation online several weeks before we left home. I made a note on the reservation that it was our 10th wedding anniversary and asked for a window seat if possible. Most tables by the window are actually for couples but there were several that weren't. When you step out of the elevator, the first thing you see is the kitchen. A nice touch actually because you can see the food being prepared very professionally. We checked in and were shown our table almost immediately. Nice tableby the window, as requested. Almost opposite the fountains of Bellagio. Unfortunately we picked the wrong night! No fountains because of the high winds, so that was a shame. Mostly waiters but we were served by a very polite and knowledgeable waitress. There was a choice of the chef's menu at $98 each or your own choice from the menu. The Chef's menu looked great actually but I don't think my wife could have eaten it all! So we chose from the usual menu. What can I say? The food was amazing! Very professionally served and presented and tasted just wonderful. The waitress was always on hand if we needed her but never 'in your face.'Here's the extra nice touch...she asked if we were celebrating anything and I told her it was our anniversary. A little while later,we were presented with an amazing desert, compliments of her and her team, on a special anniversary plate, on the house! An amazing experience and just about the best restaurant we have ever been to.Our meals came to almost $100 each, including drinks. Could be a lot more if you have the wine but my wife doesn't drink and I can't finish a bottle on my own! Very reasonable prices for the best restaurant on the strip! We highly recommend the Eiffel Tower Restaurant.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The Kir Royal hit the spot but at $20 a pop I was stunned when the bartendered grabbed our glasses and ordered us to pay up before we went to our table. Tres rude.Our table for three was lovely looking out to the fountains at Bellagio but our waiter was a bit put out to have to service us. The prix fixe menu was $98 per person which seemed high but I think you might want to consider it as the a la carte bill came out to more than that with a lot less food. The food was very good - we all had the filet mignon and each had a veggie side (at 8.95 a dish!!). The escargots app was a little different - served over risotto with yummy mushrooms but the merlot house wine was so awful we left it ($10.00 for a 1/3 filled glass !!) The waiter didn't like that we refused the Grand Marinier souffle he was hawking during the meal (the chef had to know right then so they could get them started) we had read they were $24.95 a pop so we decided to go elsewhere for desert.There was a problem with the bill where the waiter had undercharged us by over $100 dollars and when we pointed this out to him he was PUT OUT and never once thanked us for picking up his mistake. I wish we would have left him in the bag for the $100 but my friends are much nice than me! Although being abused by waiters is authentically Parisian we don't ever intend to go back to Paris, Las Vegas</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Last time was expensive, but the service, the food, the view all well worth it. We couldn't wait to return.What a dissapointment! The whole atmosphere is different now.For one thing it is very, loud with nonstop clanging dishes like a Denny's or a truckstop diner. When we were finally sat (yes, we did have reservations) we realized why. They have bus stations set up in full view of the diners inches from your table! They proceed to rattle silver and stack dirty dishes right beside you.We actually asked to move when we realized this was also to be an employee gathering spot. Our new table was only slighty better. I tried to focus on the beautiful view outside instead of paying attention when they scraped plates of leftover food into the bus tub beside me. Our waiter continually addressed us in Spanish, not sure why- though we both do have dark hair? Then he proceeded to reach directly in front of my face to grab a plate he wanted. He knew this is rude, he apologized for his reach but did it anyway . Then later did it again to get salt and pepper shaker off table.They sure seem in a hurry now to turn those tables.Food was very good. We had the salmon, 2 different ways. I didn't order much else, I was kind of sorry we didn't just leave, and at this point I only half joking told my husband "with this place if mine isn't enough I guess it will be okay just to grab what I want off of your plate!, it won't matterNothing spectacular, and for these prices it should be.Do yourself a favor read all of these reviews before you eat here.I don't think they care if you return or not. We wont- not ever!Can highly reccommend "Jasmine" across the street at Bellagio. Great food, beautiful view of fountains,beautiful restaurant, quiet romantic setting. Not cheap. But you will not feel taken advantage of .</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

As we had been in Paris a year earlier, it was an easy choice. Paris it is not. Most of the two person tables have a view of the Bellagio fountain light show. I am jaded, but it was a great distraction - and we needed some distraction.We both ordered the "tasting menu" from the waiter was distracted hoping to be discovered by some talent scout. He did nothing to make our meal memorable. He was a thorough non-entity. At least in Paris, waiters are said to be surl (I have never had surly), but good. Sub-waiters bring you your food as quickly as possible. Never the same person. No chance for human interaction, efficient, but sterile.The food. There were two seafood courses. Whoever was doing the cooking was either falling asleep or left the food on to smoke. Both the scallops and the sea bass were beyond overcooked. The chef also created a fig dish that was simply a well-executed unbalanced dish. We love figs, this was bad. When all hope was vanishing, the venison course arrived and was marvelous (we are not particularly venison eaters, but this was great). The dessert that was heavily pushed and "their specialty" by now we were dubious was the souffles. I ordered Grand Marnier and my bride a pistachio - each was heavenly.Would we go back - never. If you would like a dinner of venison and souffle, give it a try. Do not expect service good or bad, the food come and the plates go, but the staff personalities were left at the door.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Yes, it is going to cost you more then TGI Fridays but come on... this is Las Vegas - spend a few bucks and have a wonderful evening.I let the reservation desk know that we were celebrating a birthday and I was assured that we would have a wonderful table. The small romantic table over-looking the strip and Belliago fountains was excellent. The service was second to none. The food was amazing. The chef invited us into the kitchen for a wonderful birthday photo with him. Made for a very memorable evening.If you are looking for cheap Las Vegas dining this is not the place. But, if you are looking for Las Vegas sophisticated cuisine and an extensive wine list with impeccible service this is the place. Make reservations and plan for a fantastic evening of food, wine and service. WORTH EVERY PENNY.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The food was excellent and the service impeccable. I had made reservations in advance and informed the Maitre'D of the celebration. They insured that we had a table with an excellent view of the Bellagio Fountain Show and provided my companion a complimentary dessert to wish her a Happy Birthday. As an aside, the reservatioins were made through a link on the Eiffel Tower Restaurant site that provides an option to order flowers delivered at the restaurant. The flowers were waiting (a beautiful arrangement) on the table upon our arrival and managed to bring a tear to the lady's eyes. The meal was excellent (I had the Filet Mignon and she the Rack of Lamb) and prepared just as we had ordered. We both had the Cream of Sorrel soup and were pleasantly surprised (it was a new dish for the both of us). As with all restaurants of this caliber, the prices are high. However, they were not as high as I had expected (or budgeted) and (in my opinion) well worth the experience. I especially appreciated the fact that (unlike so many other restaurants and/or venues in Vegas) there was no photographer at the door or walking around taking pictures. Their policy is, if you want pictures you'll have to bring your own camera and take them yourself. All in all, a memorable birthday and dining experience and well worth another trip.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

If, however, you are a "foodie", part of that small percent of the travelling public that appreciates food as love, and presentation and service as high art, then you are in for a treat.I cannot believe I dismissed this restaurant for so long based on location. You know the old axiom- restaurants with a view charge you for just that and provide food out of mere obligation. That's why I steer clear of the highrise dining establishments In most cities.One exception of course would be Everest, in Chicago. And it was to my surprise to discover that this establishment, like Everest is a product of Chef Joho and Letuce Entertain You.Well, suffice to say, they did not disapoint. From the time our party of three was seated at a table that provided what can only be described as an overwhelming view of The Bellagio Fountains, until we finished our final desert treat several HOURS later, this experience was one to remember.The staff was top notch. The menu was esceptional. The food was divine. The wine was superior. The experience was as good as it gets.In searching my mind for a single drawback, I must stretch. And it goes back to my original disclaimer. There is a large portion of the clientelle that doesn't get it. So, if the thought of a leisurely meal, where neither the passage of time, nor the elevation of your final tab is of concern, then this IS the place for you. However, if dinner is something you want to Grab before hitting the slots, or cashing on on free show ticket you received with your package deal, do both yourself and the true foodies who should be at this establishment a favor and hit the buffett instead.In summary, I cannot give a higher endorsement to ANY restaurant I have ever been to in my life- IF you are the right person. IF you are a foodie like me, then stop looking- you have found what you are after.Enjoy!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

It was our last night in Vegas, our kids were with a babysitter and we wanted to do something special. This was one of the best restaurant experiences we have ever had. The view was amazing - watching the Bellagio fountains every 15 minutues. The food, service everything was great. We would especially recommend the souffles - to die for!!! It's not cheap but heh there's not many restaurants in Vegas that offer that view and great food. They gave us a complimentary dessert for our anniversary - much appreciated. A tiny criticism - the meals came really quickly (probably abit too quickly), they want you in and out in a reasonable time frame. We were never put under obvious pressure - it was subtle. At the end of the day it didn't worry us because we wanted to stroll the strip etc but if you want to sit for a while you may be quietly encouraged not to.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

To start I chose the duck followed by the lamb and mashed potato. My wife had the Camembert and followed it with organic chicken and we ordered a raspberry souffle to finish and it was at this point I was glad my wife was full so I didn't have to share.Service was fantastic and I couldn't find any fault with this restaurant. We paid just over $300 for our meal including taxes and a bottle of Champagne.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

What an experience!</title><review>The Eiffel Tower Restaurant is one restaurant where I'm glad I splurged and spent as much money as I did for a phenomenal meal...My girlfriend and I decided to splurge and try their tasting menu - $98/person for a 7-course meal. It's more than we've ever spent on a fine meal, but to be able to try a little bit of everything and enjoy it all made it so much more rewarding. Not to mention that we were also seated at a corner window table, overlooking the Bellagio (and the fountains) and the northern half of The Strip. The service was phenomenal as well, as our server, Maria, was very friendly and knowledgeable. It's definitely the type of place to save for a special occasion, as this was one time I had no problem spending almost $300 (including a bottle of wine as well as tax, but before gratuity) on a meal because it was totally worth every penny...We had very high expectations for this meal and were thrilled that it exceeded our expectations!!!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We had the Grand Seafood Platter for two, including Lobster, Shrimp, Crab, Oysters and Clams which was huge! The main course of Surf and Turf, Beef Tenderloin with Lump Crab Crust, was also very good. For dessert we had the Eiffel Tower Soufflés (I had the Grand Marnier and my husband had the chocolate), these had to be ordered at the start of the meal to allow the appropriate cooking time and were absolutely to die for!!!With front view seats for the Bellagio fountain spectacular this really was the perfect setting for a special occasion, they even wrote Happy Birthday on my husbands dessert plate. The service was great, very attentive. The wine list was very good. This was an expensive meal but definitely worth the cost - all in all a fantastic experience.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Went up the elevator and was greeted by a hostess who walked you to the lounge and bar area. We arrived 10 minutes prior to our reservation time, so we had a cocktail. Then our hostess came over, wished us Happy Anniversary and proceeded to escort us to our table. It was the Best Table in the House!!! They sat us at the front Corner Table with breathtaking views of the strip and of the Lake infront of the Bellagio. The water show every few minutes was a joy to behold while drinking our wine. The Waiter was outstanding, and the Food was Top Notch. From the Main Lobster appetizer until the final sip of after dinner coffee, the entire experience was picture perfect.

My husband and I both agreed that the waiter and waitstaff were decidedly uninterested. My meal (sea bass) was badly flavored; in fact, I ate only half of it and I typically clean my plate. In fairness, I have to say that my husband enjoyed his salmon. I, however, would NOT go back. After dinner, we went to Mon Ami Gabi downstairs in Paris Hotel for a drink and we both wished that we had eaten there -- it looked absolutely charming.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We had to make a last minute decision about dinner last Saturday and we chose this restaurant based on it's location. The restaurant sits many floors up directly accross from the Bellogio. The water show can be veiwed throughout dinner. The food was exceptional and the service 5 star. I would expect that based on the price and they didn't dissappoint. My husband and I both had the tasting menu. I had several glasses of wine throughout the courses reccomended by our server to compliment the food. WOW. The food was very fresh, very flavorful. The whole experience was so much fun and very romantic. The price? $300.00 That includes 3 glasses of wine, 3 beer's, tax and gratuity. This dinner was worth every penny and a highlight of our trip. The authentic french chocolate souffle at the end of the meal was to die for. Oh, and I asked about attire (my husband is SO not pretentious). They said jeans and a nice dress shirt were fine, which made him happy. We would return there for dinner.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

I told the waiter how much I love chocolate and he emptied the tray on our plate. I asked where the ladies room was- the waiter escorted me there and opened the door for me! Service was excellent- the view priceless. Many restaurants on the strip were more expensive- without the view or service! If you're trying to save money- play the penny slots downstairs, have a couple free glasses of wine, eat lots of the bread and skip dessert and coffee. After dinner go watch the fountains and have your dessert at the Bellagio.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We were asked to wait at the bar as we arrived 10 minutes early. Two cocktails $25 +tip. Soon after, we were seated directly in front of the window (only tables for two are against the windows, larger tables are set back abit). We had an amazing view of the strip and Bellagio fountains. Very memorable and breathtaking. Yes, you are paying for the view. Of course you are, But the food and service were also excellent. Appetizers, as in most higher end restaurants are too small and way overpriced. Entrees portions were larger and our choices were delicious. Complaints? not many, only minor.. they never offered more coffee and when my wife left for the restroom, her napkin was left just as she left it. Like I said minor complaints. The verdict...2 appetizers, 2 entrees, 2 side dishes (potatos/spinach), 1 glass of wine, 1 cappucino, 1 coffee...= $200+tip. This restaurant is great for memorable occasions which you don't want to forget. I reccommend it!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We were seated for dinner on time, with 100% attention to our request for a table with a view. After this point, I cannot recommend this restaurant. My husband and I both agreed that the waiter and waitstaff were decidedly uninterested. My meal (sea bass) was badly flavored; in fact, I ate only half of it and I typically clean my plate. In fairness, I have to say that my husband enjoyed his salmon. I, however, would NOT go back. After dinner, we went to Mon Ami Gabi downstairs in Paris Hotel for a drink and we both wished that we had eaten there -- it looked absolutely charming.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We had to make a last minute decision about dinner last Saturday and we chose this restaurant based on it's location. The restaurant sits many floors up directly accross from the Bellogio. The water show can be veiwed throughout dinner. The food was exceptional and the service 5 star. I would expect that based on the price and they didn't dissappoint. My husband and I both had the tasting menu. I had several glasses of wine throughout the courses reccomended by our server to compliment the food. WOW. The food was very fresh, very flavorful. The whole experience was so much fun and very romantic. The price? $300.00 That includes 3 glasses of wine, 3 beer's, tax and gratuity. This dinner was worth every penny and a highlight of our trip. The authentic french chocolate souffle at the end of the meal was to die for. Oh, and I asked about attire (my husband is SO not pretentious). They said jeans and a nice dress shirt were fine, which made him happy. We would return there for dinner.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Cocktails were $12-14 dollars. Not bad for the ambience and view. Appetizers, drinks and dinner were $150 for the two of us. Skip dessert- they bring you a tray of sweets. I told the waiter how much I love chocolate and he emptied the tray on our plate. I asked where the ladies room was- the waiter escorted me there and opened the door for me! Service was excellent- the view priceless. Many restaurants on the strip were more expensive- without the view or service! If you're trying to save money- play the penny slots downstairs, have a couple free glasses of wine, eat lots of the bread and skip dessert and coffee. After dinner go watch the fountains and have your dessert at the Bellagio.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

The food was outstanding, sevice magnificent, and our table had a view of the water show at Bellagio. They went out of their way to make our dinner here a memorable event. The price was a little more than we usually spend on special occasion dinners, but I think being married for 25 yrs justified the price. We would definately return on another special occasion.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

We were asked to wait at the bar as we arrived 10 minutes early. Two cocktails $25 +tip. Soon after, we were seated directly in front of the window (only tables for two are against the windows, larger tables are set back abit). We had an amazing view of the strip and Bellagio fountains. Very memorable and breathtaking. Yes, you are paying for the view. Of course you are, But the food and service were also excellent. Appetizers, as in most higher end restaurants are too small and way overpriced. Entrees portions were larger and our choices were delicious. Complaints? not many, only minor.. they never offered more coffee and when my wife left for the restroom, her napkin was left just as she left it. Like I said minor complaints. The verdict...2 appetizers, 2 entrees, 2 side dishes (potatos/spinach), 1 glass of wine, 1 cappucino, 1 coffee...= $200+tip. This restaurant is great for memorable occasions which you don't want to forget. I reccommend it!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

Perfect service, diverse menu, lovely views, and most importantly, the food was great! May be a bit pricey, but we saw that everywhere we dined in Vegas. I would assume most of that food is coming a far way to be on those plates.Our whole experience was perfect, and we even got to watch the fountain show at the Bellagio.There was a table next to us that did not fair as well. They struggled to find anything on the menu they wanted, and the woman in the end was not happy with her food. The waiter immediately wanted to take the plate away and get her anything off the menu she wanted, on the house. She refused, I thought she was crazy. But the waiter was great, "we don't want you to have a bad experience. We don't want you to sit there and eat something you don't like." But she still would have none of it. In the end they looked very unhappy when they left. But I think it said a lot of the staff and management about how hard they tried to accomodate.But our foie gras, escargots, rack of lamb, filet mignon with foie gras and sizable chocolate souffle just rocked. Yes I was that happy! Last bit, the sommelier was very helpful and checked on us through the meal to make sure all was well with our wine.</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>

After reading some of the comments on the quality of the food, I was hesitant to spend the money, but we opted to go for it for the romantic ambience and the amazing view of the of the Bellagio fountains. We were not disappointed. In fact, I would say the food was fabulous. We both had a delectable meal with top notch service. From the bread, to appetizer, main course and desserts, everything was flawless, and we've eaten at some of the best restaurants in NYC. Our waiter, Charles, was classy, attentive and knowledgable. Our view was absolutely spectacular - the fountains at night are a sight to behold. Even without hearing the music, it was magical. The prices are steep, it was the most expensive meal we've ever had in 15 years together. But also, now, one of the most memorable. I would highly recommend it based on the food, view and ambience - the combination would be difficult to find elsewhere on the strip. For a very special occasion or to really impress someone special, splurge - you'll be happy you did!</review><polarity>NULL</polarity><confidence>NULL</confidence></doc>
